<h2 id="Editors_Introduction">Editor’s Introduction</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Butler</span> was born at Wantage, England, May 18th, 1692,
the youngest of eight children. The biographies of that day were
few and meagre; and in few cases is this so much to be regretted as
in Butler’s. It would have been both interesting and profitable to
trace the development and occupations of one of the mightiest of
human minds. But no cotemporary gathered up the incidents of his
life, and now all efforts to elicit them have been without success.</p>

<p>His father was a prosperous dry-goods merchant, who, at the time
of his son’s birth, had retired from business with a competency, and
resided in a suburban mansion called “The Priory,” still in existence.</p>

<p>Being a non-conformist, he educated Joseph at a “dissenting”
academy at Gloucester, under <span class="smcap">Samuel Jones</span>, a gentleman of great
ability, and a skilful instructor, who raised up some of the greatest
men of their day.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It was while a member of this academy, and about the age of
twenty-one, that Butler disclosed to the world his wonderful power of
abstract reasoning, in his famous correspondence with Samuel Clarke,
in relation to that eminent author’s “<cite>Demonstration of the Being and
Attributes of God</cite>.” This correspondence is now generally inserted
at the end of that work.</p>

<p>Mr. Butler having deliberately adopted Episcopal views, and resolved
to unite himself with the Established Church, his father, with
praiseworthy liberality, sent him to Oxford, where he entered Oriel
College, March, 1714. Of his college life there is no account; nor
of the time and place of his ordination. He removed to London
in 1718, on receiving the appointment of “Preacher at the Rolls.”
His famous Fifteen Sermons were preached in that chapel, and
published before resigning the place, with a dedication to Sir Joseph
Jekyl, “as a parting mark of gratitude for the favors received during
his connection with that learned society.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>One of Butler’s warmest college friends was Edward Talbot
second son of a clergyman who afterwards became Bishop of Durham.
This admirable young man died of smallpox; in his last hours recommending
Butler to his father’s patronage; and scarcely had that
gentleman attained the see of Durham, before he gave Mr. B. the
living of Haughton, from whence he transferred him, in 1725, to the
richer benefice of Stanhope.</p>

<p>On receiving this honorable and lucrative appointment, he resigned
the Lectureship at the Rolls, and in the autumn of 1726 retired
to his beautiful residence at Stanhope. Here, without a family to
occupy his time, he devoted himself to his great work, the Analogy:
using horseback exercise, seeing little company, living abstemiously
and caring for his flock.</p>

<p>Seven years thus rolled away; when to draw him from what seemed
to his friends too great retirement and application, Lord-Chancellor
Talbot made him his chaplain, and afterwards, in 1736, gave him a
prebend’s stall in Rochester. In 1736, Butler being now forty-four,
Caroline, consort of George II., appointed him “Clerk of the Closet,”
an office which merely required his attendance at the Queen’s apartments
every evening, from seven to nine.</p>

<p>Being now in London, convenient to the press, and enjoying both
leisure and competency, he published his immortal <span class="smcap">Analogy</span>&mdash;the
cherished work of his life. The Queen was delighted with the book,
and made herself master of its glorious array of reasoning. But she
died the same year, and he lost not only a patroness, but a friend.
He returned to his benefice at Stanhope, the income of which had
been held during his residence in London.</p>

<p>On her death-bed, the Queen had urged her husband to promote
her honored chaplain to a bishopric; and next year, the see of
Norwich becoming vacant, the Bishop of Bristol was translated to it,
and the see of Bristol given to Butler. Bristol was the poorest
bishopric in England, its emoluments being but $2,000 per annum;
less than those of the rectorship of Stanhope. Butler distinctly
disclosed his disappointment in his letter to the minister Walpole,
accepting the position; and declared that he did not think it “very
suitable to the condition of his fortune, nor answerable to the recommendation
with which he was honored.” The king was not displeased
at this candor, and in 1740 improved his income by giving
him, in addition to his bishopric, the profitable and influential office
of Dean of St. Paul’s. Butler, who had retained the living of Stanhope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
along with his bishopric, now resigned that rectorship. “The
rich revenues,” says Professor Fitzgerald, “of the Deanery of St. Paul,
enabled him to gratify his taste at Bristol.” He expended about
$25,000 in improving and beautifying the episcopal residence and
gardens. He fostered useful charities, and employed his wealth for
others rather than for himself.</p>

<p>In 1750, upon the death of Dr. Edward Chandler, Bishop of
Durham, Butler was promoted to that see, the most honorable and
lucrative in England. He had before been offered the Primacy, on
the death of Archbishop Potter, but declined it, with the remark that
“it was too late for him to try to support a falling church.” On
assuming his diocese at Durham, Butler delivered and published his
famous Charge to the Clergy, upon “The Use and Importance of
External Religion.” He was at once assailed vigorously, in pamphlets
and papers, by Archdeacon Blackburn, the Rev. T. Lindsay, and
others, on the charge of Popery; an imputation which is still sometimes
cast upon him, and which finds some slender support in his
setting up a marble cross over the communion-table at Bristol. That
he never was a Papist, is now so evident, that we can account for the
imputation only by the strong jealousy of the Romish Church then
prevalent.</p>

<p>Butler now became still more munificent. His private charities
were exceedingly generous, and his public ones seemed sometimes to
border on extravagance. He gave $2,000 a year to the county hospital,
and often gave away thousands of dollars at a time. But though
quite lavish in buildings and ornaments, as well as in benevolence,
he was remarkably frugal in his personal expenses. It is said of
him, by Rev. John Newton, that on one occasion, when a distinguished
visitor dined with him by appointment, the provision consisted
of a single joint of meat, and a pudding. The bishop remarked
to his guest on that occasion, that he “had long been disgusted with
the fashionable expense of time and money in entertainments, and
was determined that it should receive no countenance from his
example.”</p>

<p>Of his amusements we know little except that he took much horseback
exercise, and often employed his secretary, Mr. Emms, to play
for him on the organ.</p>

<p>Butler held the see of Durham less than two years. Symptoms
of general physical decay betrayed themselves about the time of
his promotion, and in spite of all that skill and affection could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
prompt, he sunk to rest June 16th, 1752, aged sixty. He was never
married.</p>

<p>A considerable number of his sermons and charges have been
printed, but are too philosophical to be generally read. His great
work is the Analogy, published in 1736, and from that day read and
admired by every highly-cultivated mind. He was induced to write
by a state of things very remarkable in the history of religion.
Debauchery and infidelity were almost universal, not in any one class
of society but in all. England had reached the culminating point
of irreligion, and the firm re-establishment of Episcopacy had as yet
done nothing to mend the nation’s morals. Piety was deemed a mark
of ignorance and vulgarity, and multitudes of those who professed it
were persecuted to dungeons and death.</p>

<p>Infidel writers, warmed into life by court corruption, became more
numerous and audacious than ever before. Their methods of attacking
Christianity were various; but the most successful then, as
always, was to impugn certain doctrines and declarations of the
Sacred Scriptures, as irrational, and hence reject the whole. They
generally admitted the Being and perfection of God, and extolled the
sufficiency of natural religion; but denied any revelation, or any
necessity for one. The verdict of the world was that the Bible is not
authentic, that man is not accountable, nor even probably immortal,
that God neither rewards nor punishes, and that present indulgence,
as far as our nature admits, is both wise and safe.</p>

<p>Bishop Downam,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> one of the most learned of the clergy, in the
early part of the seventeenth century writes thus: “In these times,
if a man do but labor to keep a good conscience, though he meddle
not with matters of state, if he make conscience of swearing, sanctify
the Sabbath, frequent sermons, or abstain from the common corruptions
of the times, he shall straightway be condemned for a puritan,
and be less favored than either a carnal gospeller, or a close Papist.”</p>

<p>It was considered settled, especially in polite circles, that Christianity,
after so long a prevalence, had been found out to be an imposture.
The clergy, as a body, did nothing to dispel this moral
gloom, but rather increased it by their violent and scandalous conduct.
In the sad language of Bishop Warburton, “Religion had
lost its hold on the minds of the people.” He adds with great point,
“Though a <em>rule of right</em> may direct the philosopher to a principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
action; and the <em>point of honor</em> may keep up the thing called manners,
among gentlemen: yet nothing but <em>religion</em> can ever fix a sober
standard of behavior among the common people.” Even the universities
were on the side of irreligion; for professorships, as well as
pulpits, were given to men, not for positive worth and fitness, but for
possessing qualities then most in vogue with those who held the
appointing power. Such were the trying times which had driven our
pilgrim fathers to seek a home amid the wilds of an unexplored continent,
and to face the dangers of sea and savage.</p>

<p>It must ever be regarded as among the highest instances of God’s
bringing good out of evil, that this outrageous rampancy of infidelity
brought out a host of champions for the truth of His word; who
boldly met the odium of discipleship, and waged battle in such style
that the Deistical controversy was settled forever. Never was a dispute
more determined on both sides, and never was victory more
complete. Literary infidelity not only recoiled, but was routed; and
can never again prevail. Henceforth, no <em>scholar</em> will ever treat the
evidences of Christianity as a subject of ridicule or contempt.</p>

<p>When we contrast the stupendous learning, and powerful logic, of
the Christian writers of that century, with the superficial and almost
contemptible productions of the writers against whom they contended,
we are tempted to wonder why such power should be requisite to
overthrow such weakness. But we must remember, that frail logic
and shallow considerations, will persuade men to indulge their vices;
while the soundest reasonings and the most impressive inducements,
with difficulty lead them to self-restraint and true holiness.</p>

<p>The infidel writers of that day have sunk into such oblivion that
their works are now seldom found but in great libraries; and even
well-educated persons scarcely know more of them than their names.
Yet so perfectly did their principles accord with the temper of the
times and the universal depravity of the carnal heart, that they
enjoyed the highest popularity with all classes. Forever honored be
the names of that noble band, who, in face of such odds, established
the authority of the Bible, and left the advocates of atheism and immorality
without a lurking-place.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In this noble cohort Butler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
stands conspicuous: and to him, I think, more than to all the others,
is to be attributed the sudden and total overthrow of infidelity, when
it was in its glory.</p>

<p>As a metaphysician, few have equalled him. What he added to
the science, has ever since remained a part of it, which can be said
of scarcely another. He advanced more that was new, fortified old
positions more ably, and applied speculation to religion more usefully
than any before him. Our language furnishes no profounder thinking.
Merely to understand him is an honorable distinction, and requires
no small previous training of the power of attention. As a polemic,
he is keen, sagacious, candid, patient, persevering, calm, inventive,
and profound: every page indicates that repose of mind, which belongs
only to true greatness, combined with a full knowledge of the subject.
So far as I am able to judge, he never presses a consideration beyond
its just limits, and seldom introduces an illustration which has not
the force of an argument. Fallacies he seems to abolish at a touch.</p>

<p>The Analogy employed much of his life. It was begun in his
twentieth year, but was not published till he was forty-five. Such a
mode of writing never makes large books, for the matter, constantly
revised, becomes constantly condensed. The Analogy is so condensed,
as that to make a satisfactory synopsis is scarcely practicable.
Hence, though my Conspectus and notes have aided my pupils to
understand and remember the argument, they do not in any measure
obviate the necessity of studying the book itself. If they do not
increase the number of those who shall studiously peruse the book
itself, my aim and expectations will be disappointed.</p>

<p>To this work no reply has ever been attempted! Extensive as is
its diffusion, and great as is its acknowledged influence, infidelity has
had the highest inducements to attempt to set it aside. Written for
a present purpose, and most signally accomplishing it, it is yet so
written as to endure, in full value, through all coming time. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
undoubtedly “the most original and the most profound work extant,
in any language, on the philosophy of religion,”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “the most argumentative
and philosophical defence of Christianity ever submitted
to the world.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Writers in defence of Christianity had, before Butler, amply discussed
the several departments of evidences; but still there remained
objections. The structure of the globe, the course of nature, the
organization of animals, &amp;c. were affirmed to contradict revelation.
Its doctrines and duties, moreover, were pronounced inconsistent with
sound reason. Butler repeats none of the old arguments, but confines
himself to the showing that the declarations of revelation are in perfect
harmony with facts seen daily in the world, and which all admit.
That the world might not have been ordered and governed otherwise,
he does not choose to dispute. Taking things as they are, and closely
studying the connection between one thing and another, we ought to
inquire what course of action on our part, will conform to the needs
of such a nature and such circumstances. Our bodies are constructed
of parts, all adapted to each other, and also to one general end. So
too, our souls. And the two together have relations and adaptations,
which may, to some extent at least, indicate what is designed to be
the <em>general</em> end of our existence. If Christianity befits these several
parts of our mixed nature and their obvious uses, then there is nothing
incongruous between the two; and no objections against Christianity
can be drawn from the course of nature. On the contrary, all
seems to be governed as the gospel declares it is, and shows that the
Author of man and the Author of the Bible is the same. This is still
more impressive when we consider that we have a <em>moral faculty</em>; for
it is the very object and business of this faculty to deal with right
and wrong, good and evil; the facts and magnitudes of which are
obvious in the course of nature. If Christianity does, in an especial
manner, <em>befit</em> this faculty, if it is adapted to promote our general
rectitude and happiness, and if it contains no principle which is not
discernible in the government of the visible world, then there is no
discrepancy between Christianity and Providence.</p>

<p>This is Butler’s position. He confines himself to proving such an
analogy between revelation and the daily course of things, as that
nothing known in the universe can be offered in disproof of Christianity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The mode of warfare was new. Without professing to
prove Christianity to be true, he demonstrates that it cannot be
proved to be false; and that if it be even probable, the rejection of it
is a gross folly and a tremendous hazard. Every objection against it
he proves to be equally forcible against facts which constantly occur,
and which all admit, though none profess to understand. Thus leaving
the ramparts of the church to be guarded by the mighty men
who had valiantly maintained its defence, he quietly walked out into
the camp of the enemy, and spiked every gun!</p>

<p>It has been said that the whole argument of the “Analogy” seems
to be built on Ecclesiasticus xlii. 24: “All things are double, one
against the other, and God hath made nothing imperfect.” If it be
so, it involves no disparagement to have received thus the seminal
idea of this immortal work. Who else has so gloriously discerned
and expanded the profound philosophy of the son of Sirac? Others
have uttered sentiments which seem to involve the whole exposition
of Butler. Origen affirms that “he who believes the Scripture to
have proceeded from Him who is the Author of nature, may well expect
to find the same sort of difficulties in it, as are found in nature.”
Shall we assign to Origen the whole credit of the “Analogy”? As
well might we bestow all our admiration for the delightful papers of
Addison, in the Spectator, to the classical authors from whom he
selected appropriate mottoes! By such a rule, the entire merit of
this most Christian work of Butler should be attributed to the pagan
Quintilian, from whom he derives the motto which so appropriately
graces his title-page.</p>

<p>A rapid sketch of the outline of the argument will aid the student
at his outset. He begins by taking for granted the existence of an
intelligent Author and Governor of the universe. Then, from the conditions
and changes observed in the visible world, he argues the folly
of objecting to revelation on account of doctrines which do but
declare the same general laws and the same principles of government.
That there is this harmony, he proves; and hence the probability
that the same sort of government will prevail hereafter, which
prevails now. He demonstrates that man is under exactly such a
probation in this world, and as to this world, as revelation affirms
him to be under, as to the next; and that embarrassments produced
by the doctrine of necessity, involve nature no less than religion. He
then evinces the need that man should be placed in a state of training
and trial, if he is ever to be qualified for better conditions; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that this world, as now governed, is exactly adapted to give that
training, and to produce such a character as will insure happiness
under any possible contingencies. This is the argument of Part I.</p>

<p>Proceeding to examine Christianity, he discusses its importance, its
proofs, the unavoidableness of its containing strange things, the
absurdity of expecting fully to comprehend its statements, and the
abundance of its evidence for candid minds, though they are not,
and ought not to be, irresistible. He answers not only the objections
to Christianity, but the objections against its proofs; which he shows
are very different things. Though he keeps rigidly to the refutation
of objections, and nowhere meddles with the direct evidence of Christianity,
yet, by removing every objection, he does in fact confirm its
claims. This clearing away of objections, <em>after</em> the usual proofs are
presented, crowns and completes the evidence. Thus the ultimate
result of a study of his book is not only negative but positive; and
such has been its effect on every candid and competent student.</p>

<p>We should remember that we have no right to require the removal
of objections, and that therefore the whole of Butler’s work is in fact
supererogatory; a concession and kindness to such as have doubts,
either honest or captious. Our only rightful demand of Christianity
is for <em>credentials</em>. It presents these in its nature, its miracles, its
prophecies, its propagation, its influence, and its success. If these
are competent, we should bow to its teachings. To suppose that we
are capable of judging of the <em>propriety</em> of all God’s law, or even to
understand his reasons for it, if they were disclosed, is absurd.</p>

<p>It is true we naturally presume that a revelation in words, and a
revelation by natural objects and the visible order of things, would
coincide; but to find out the fact or the extent of such coincidence,
is not our first business. We are to weigh the <em>testimony</em> in favor of
religion, embrace it, if sufficient, and attribute the obscurity of any
part, to our present want of capacity. The solution of difficulties
serves to <em>confirm</em> our faith in Christianity, but has no place in our
<em>ground of reception</em>: and we have no right to wait for such solution,
however painful and embarrassing may be the difficulties.</p>

<p>Another, and perhaps even more important, use of the “Analogy,”
is to dissipate the prejudices and objections to Christianity which
prevent a candid study of its evidences. These prepossess and poison
the mind, and obstruct or abate the force of the best arguments.
Few, if any, after a careful examination of the positive evidences of
Christianity, conclude them to be inadequate. But many are they,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
who having heard objections which their scanty learning does not
enable them to answer, and their no less scanty interest in the subject
does not induce them to examine, or which their inclinations lead
them to cherish, cast it all aside. In this way they relieve themselves
from the labor of investigation, as well as their compunctions of
conscience; while they indulge both their love of sin and pride of
singularity.</p>

<p>An instance of the use of this book to such a mind, we have in the
case of Chalmers. He had read, when a young man, several infidel
productions. Their semblance of logic and learning, and supercilious
confidence of style, disposed him to regard all religion as mere superstition.
His mind was poisoned. Accustomed as he had been to the
positive and precise reasonings of mathematics, he could not find
similar proofs for Christianity. But he was induced, by some friends,
to study Butler’s Analogy. This, as he expresses it, took Christianity
“out of the class of unlikelihoods.” It brought him to the investigation,
as if the evidence was neither plus nor minus. He examined
the evidences as he would have done a declaration that Cicero weighed
just one hundred and fifty pounds; open to the smallest proof or
presumption on the positive side of the question. Delivered from
prejudice, not only against Christianity but against its proofs, he soon
saw the madness of deism, and immovably accepted the word of
God, though he did not, at that time, feel its transforming power
on his own heart. Long afterwards he writes, “I cannot render
sufficient homage to the argument, which first, addressing itself to the
<em>subject-matter</em> of Christianity, relieves it of all disproof, and pronounces
it worthy of a trial; and then, addressing itself to the evidence
of Christianity, relieves it of all objections, and makes good, to
that evidence, all the entireness and efficiency which natively belong
to it.” Years afterwards he said, “Butler made me a Christian.”
That it did far more for him than to effect his change of sentiment,
that it continued to be a light in his firmament, is touchingly told in
the Preface of his Bridgewater Treatise, where he says, “I have
derived greater aid from the views and reasonings of Butler, than I
have been able to find, besides, in the whole range of our extant
authorship.”</p>

<p>To the sincere believer in the word of God the study of Butler is
of great use. Doubts are among Satan’s tried weapons, and often
haunt the holiest, especially if of a contemplative turn. They see
goodness oppressed, and vice rampant; the world ruled by wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
men, and truth making its way with difficulty. Their hearts are
traitorous, their surroundings full of temptation, and the direct evidence
of Christianity they may never have studied. To such the
analogical argument comes with full power, meets a candid examination,
and prevails.</p>

<p>To no Christian is this book so useful as the minister. He is constantly
confronted by the difficulties which Butler so triumphantly
handles. Here he is furnished, not only with a shield to protect his
own mind from subtle darts, but a sword to demolish the cavil, and
defend the system of which he is a public teacher.</p>

<p>To <em>all</em> persons this book is of great value. We arrive at certainty
in but few of our decisions, and are often obliged, even in matters of
great moment, to act on probability. Thus we employ precautions
when an evil is not certain to occur. If the evil would be very
serious, we adopt the precaution, when there is but little probability,
or perhaps a bare possibility, of its occurrence. Now, Butler has
shown that if the proofs of revelation were weak, nay, if it had absolutely
no proof, nay further, if on fair examination there appeared
not even a probability of its truth, still there would remain a <em>possibility</em>,
and this alone, considering the tremendous issues at stake,
should make every man a Christian. This argument cannot be
applied to Mahometanism or any other religion, because against those
much may be advanced as <em>disproof</em>. Our author, having shown the
utter absence of disproof, shuts us up to the reception of Christianity,
were its truth barely possible.</p>

<p>There have not been wanting persons to disparage the “Analogy,”
because it affords, as they say, no <em>direct</em> proof of revelation. As well
might we demand a discussion of chemistry in a work on astronomy.
Scores of writers <em>prove</em> Christianity, and here we have one to relieve
us from the difficulties which beset it, and objections which still
remain. There is an aspect in which the Analogy may be said to
contribute the best of proof. What can go further towards establishing
a point, than to demonstrate that there is no proof of the contrary?
What can show the fallacy of a set of objections, more than
to prove that they might be urged with no less force against the
obvious course of nature? This use of analogy is conformable to the
severest logic, and though offering no pretence of positive argument,
goes far towards establishing full conviction. “The probabilities,”
says <span class="smcap">Stewart</span>, “resulting from a concurrence of different analogies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
may rise so high as to produce an effect on the belief scarcely distinguishable
from moral certainty.”</p>

<p>When it is considered that Butler’s argument is wholly in addition
to the cumulative mass of direct and almost irresistible evidence,
and removes even the objections which attend the subject, we see the
rejection of Christianity to be inexpressibly rash and absurd. We
see the skeptic condemned at his own bar, for acting in the most
momentous of all possible concerns, in a manner the very opposite of
that which he calls sensible and prudent in his ordinary affairs. The
“Analogy” establishes, beyond cavil, strong <em>presumptions</em> that Christianity
is true, aside from all inspection of its proofs. The man,
therefore, who really understands this book, and refuses to be a
Christian, is led by his lusts and not his reason.</p>

<p>Some admirers of this book have lamented as a defect, its want of
evangelical tincture, and its exclusive reference to natural things.
To me, this is a prime recommendation. Were it otherwise, the
reasoning would be in a circle. The very structure of the argument
demands that it should avoid quotations from the Bible.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, that some expressions, taken just
as they stand, without qualification by the current of the argument,
tend to lead astray. For instance, “There is nothing in the human
mind contrary to virtue.” “Men’s happiness and virtue are left to
themselves.” “Religion requires nothing which we are not well
able to perform.” “Our repentance is accepted, to eternal life.”
“Our relations to God are made known by reason.” Such expressions
are not to be taken alone, but as explained by the general drift
of sentiment and doctrine. No one can be familiar with his works,
without finding the fullest evidence that Christianity was to Butler
infinitely more than a creed or a ritual. Nor should we forget that
such expressions are not to be interpreted by the tenor of the
“Analogy” only, but by that of his whole ‘Works.’</p>

<p>Even if it be judged that he everywhere fails to express himself in
such phrase as we usually call evangelical, it should be remembered
that he was a Church-of-England man, at a time when there was a
powerful reaction against the evangelism of the Puritans, and when
a real lack of emotional piety was general in his church.</p>

<p>That he did not enjoy in his last illness, which extended over a
long period, that sustaining sense of the love of Christ which hearty
Christians generally feel, is certain. A friend, trying to relieve his
depression, reminded him of his excellent life, and especially his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
wide liberalities. He immediately replied, “l am but a steward!
All is His, intrusted to me, to promote his glory and the good of
mankind; how can I know that I have not abused the trust? I
reflect on all these things, and they fill my soul with terror by the
feeling of responsibility they awaken.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, his chaplain sought to soothe his troubled spirit
by referring to the extensive influence of his <cite>Analogy</cite> in reclaiming
skeptics. His reply was, “I <em>began</em> the Analogy with a view to the
glory of God; but as I proceeded, visions of the fame it might bring
me mingled themselves with my motives, and all was polluted and
made sinful! The book may be a blessing to others, but it weighs like
lead on my soul.” “Admit all this,” tenderly replied the chaplain;
“yet has not Jesus said, ‘Whosoever cometh unto me shall in no wise
be cast out’?” Instantly the Bishop raised himself in the bed, exclaiming,
“How wonderful that the force of this passage never struck
me before! ‘Whosoever,’&mdash;<em>all</em>, <span class="smcapuc">ALL</span>! ‘In no wise,’&mdash;no amount of
sin can prevent acceptance! Christ’s righteousness will hide the
iniquities of <em>all</em> who accept his offer of mercy!”</p>

<p>From that time, for weeks, Butler spoke to all who approached
him, of a <em>full</em> and <em>free</em> salvation. He died triumphantly repeating
this passage.</p>

<p>If all that is said of the lack of evangelical sentiment in Butler or
his book be conceded, it certainly cannot impair either the value of
the analogical argument, or the force of our author’s use of it.</p>

<p>Various circumstances conspire to make the study of “The
Analogy” difficult. The nature of the reasoning&mdash;the conciseness,
and often obscurity of the style&mdash;the dislocation of parts by frequent
digressions&mdash;the arrest of a close course of reasoning to answer
objections&mdash;and the abstruseness of the subject itself&mdash;combine to
make the full comprehension of its import difficult. Mackintosh says,
“No thinker so great, was ever so bad a writer.” But this, like some
other objections of Sir James, is stated too strongly. The language
is good, sinewy Saxon, and will endure when much that is now
called fine writing, will seem grotesque. Still it is possible to
write philosophy in better phrase, as has been shown by at least
two great men, Berkeley and Stewart. Had Butler but possessed the
glowing style of Berkeley, or the smooth, graceful, and transparent
diction of Dugald Stewart, his work, instead of serving only for close
thinkers, or a college text-book, would have been read by all classes,
and banished that vulgar infidelity which flippant writers still disseminate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
That it is thus restricted in its influence is a misfortune
to the world. But he wrote for a class, and did his work completely.
Literary infidelity was conquered. Vulgar, ignorant, licentious
infidelity, will always exist, and is even now deplorably prevalent.
Both Europe and America contain conceited and malignant ignoramuses,
who by their sneers, their cavils, and their audacity, make
havoc of souls. Of these, Tom Paine is a type, whose book, the
contempt of cultivated minds, continues to be sold and read. For
this class of persons, “Baxter’s Call,” or “Alleine’s Alarm,” are
far more suitable than treatises on the evidences of Christianity, or
even Butler’s Analogy.</p>

<h2 id="Editors_Preface">Editor’s Preface.</h2>

<p>The text is the result of a careful collation of the various principal
editions. Occasionally solecisms are corrected, and a word transposed
or put in italics, when a sentence could thus be made perspicuous.
The author had a fashion of beginning a large proportion of his sentences
with “and,” “but,” “now,” “indeed,” “however,” &amp;c., which
often served to perplex, and in such cases they have been omitted.
Long paragraphs, comprehending different topics, have been so
divided as to correspond with the true analysis; which will greatly
assist the student in detecting the successive stages of the argument.
Special pains has been taken to correct and improve the punctuation.
Hundreds of sentences have thus been rendered more perspicuous,
and many which were obscure, have been made lucid. In no respect
was Butler’s style, as printed, so defective.</p>

<p>The Conspectus is made much ampler than any other, for this
reason: that students are apt to content themselves with such help
instead of mastering the full discussion by the author. In the present
case they cannot so do, for such is the fulness of the Conspectus, that
if they master this, they have mastered the subject itself in full.</p>

<p>Notes by the present editor are distinguished from those of the
author by being enclosed in brackets. They are designed to open out
further views, to elucidate the text, to facilitate extended researches,
and to suggest topics for conversation in the class-room.</p>

<p>The Index has cost far more labor than would be supposed, and
may not be of much benefit to the undergraduate. Its advantages
will not be small to him in after life when he desires to recur to particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
topics. The general scholar will find it enables him to make
use of the book for occasional reference. Without it the work is not
complete for the class-room, still less for the library.</p>

<p>That students of the Analogy need help, is confessed; and all
attempts to furnish it have been kindly received. As is remarked by
Bishop Wilson, “His argument, clear and convincing as it is to a
prepared mind, is not obvious to the young reader, whose experience
of life being small, and his habits of reflection feeble, has not the
furniture necessary for comprehending, at first, the thoughts and
conclusions of such a mind. The style is too close, too negligent, too
obscure, to be suitable for the young.”</p>

<p>If it be asked why, with several existing helps to the study of the
Analogy, I offer another, I frankly reply, because I have found none
of them satisfactory, either to the public or to myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some teachers prefer their text-books to be accompanied by a set
of questions. Such will find in this edition all they desire. They
have only to enunciate each sentence of the Conspectus in the
interrogative form, and they will have every possible question
prepared to their hand.</p>

          for such speculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">3.) We are, to some extent, judges as to <em>ends</em>; and may conclude that Nature
      and Providence are designed to produce virtue and happiness;
      but of the <em>means</em> of producing these in the highest degree, we are not
      competent judges.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Instead of vainly, and perhaps sinfully, imagining schemes for God’s

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>Presumptions against a future life.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> That death <em>destroys</em> us.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. This is an assumption that we are compound and material beings, and
      hence discerptible; which is not true.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) Consciousness is a single, indivisible power, and of course the subject of
            it must be.</li>
            <li class="consp">2.) The material body is not ourself.</li>
            <li class="consp">3.) We can easily conceive of our having more limbs, or of a different kind,
            or of having more or fewer senses, or of having no bodies at all, or of
            hereafter animating these same bodies, remodelled.</li>
            <li class="consp">4.) The dissolution of a succession of new and strange bodies, would have
            no tendency to destroy <em>us</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 2. Though the absolute simplicity of the living being cannot be proved by
      <em>experiment</em>, yet facts lead us so to conclude. We lose limbs, &amp;c.
      Our bodies were once <em>very</em> small, but we might, then, have lost part
      of them. There is a constant destruction and renewal going on.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) Thus we see that no certain <em>bulk</em> is necessary to our existence, and unless
          it were proved that there is, and that it is larger than an indissoluble
          atom, there is no reason to presume that death destroys us, even if we
          are discerptible.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) The living agent is not an <em>internal material organism</em>, which dies with
          the body. Because <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;Our only ground for this presumption is our relation to other systems
              of matter. But we see these are not necessary to us.</li>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;It will not do to say that lost portions of the body were not <em>essential</em>&mdash;who
              is to determine?</li>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;The relation between the living agent, and the most essential parts of
              the body, is only one by which they mutually affect each other.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="consp">3.) If we regard our body as made up of organs of sense, we come to the
          same result.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;We see with the eyes, just as we do with glasses. The eye is not a
              <em>recipient</em>, any more than a telescope.</li>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;It is not pretended that vision, hearing, &amp;c. can be traced clear up to
              the percipient; but so far as we can trace perceptions, the <em>organ</em>
              does not perceive.</li>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;In dreams we perceive without organs.</li>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;When we lose a limb we do not lose the <em>directing power</em>; we could
              move a new one, if it could be made, or a wooden one. But the
              limb cut off has no power of moving.</li>
              <li class="consp">&mdash;Thus, our loss of the <em>organs</em> of perception and motion, not being the
              destruction of the power, there is no ground to think that the destruction
              of other organs or instruments would destroy <em>us</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objection.</i> These observations apply equally to brutes.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. Be it so. Perhaps they are immortal:&mdash;may hereafter improve: we
      know not what latent powers they may have.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) The human being at one period looks as little likely to make great
          intellectual attainments; for a long time he has capacities for virtue
          and religion, but cannot use them.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) Many persons go out of the world who never became able to exercise
          these capacities; <i>e.g.</i> infants.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 2. If brutes were immortal, it does not prove them to be <em>moral agents</em>.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) It may be necessary, for aught we know, that there should be living
          creatures not moral agents, nor rational.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) All difficulties as to what would become of them, are founded in our
          ignorance.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> That our souls, though not material, so depend upon the bodily structure,
  that we cannot survive its destruction.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. Reason, memory, &amp;c. <em>do not</em> depend on the body, as perceptions by
      the senses do. Death may destroy those <em>instruments</em>, and yet not
      destroy the <em>powers</em> of reflection.</li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 2. Human beings exist, here, in two very different states, each having its
      own laws: sensation and reflection. By the first we feel; by the
      second we reason and will.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) Nothing which we know to be destroyed at death, is necessary to reflecting
          on ideas formerly received.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) Though the senses act like scaffolds, or levers, to <em>bring in</em> ideas, yet when
          once in, we can reflect, &amp;c. without their aid.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 3. There are diseases which prove fatal, &amp;c., yet do not, in any part of
      their course, <em>impair</em> the intellect; and this indicates that they do not
      <em>destroy</em> it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) In the diseases alluded to, persons have their reflective power, in full,
          the very moment before death.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) Now, why should a disease, at a certain degree, utterly destroy powers
          which were not even affected by it, up to that point?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> That death at least <em>suspends</em> our reflective powers, or interrupts our continuing
  to exist in the like state of reflection which we do now.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> There appears so little connection between our powers of sensation and
      our powers of reflection that we cannot presume that what might
      <em>destroy the former</em>, could even <em>suspend the latter</em>.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) We daily see reason, memory, &amp;c. exercised without any assistance, that
          we know of, from our bodies.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) Seeing them in lively exercise to the last, we must infer that death is not
          a discontinuance of their exercise, nor of the enjoyments and sufferings
          of such exercise.</li>
          <li class="consp">3.) Our posthumous life may be but a going on, with additions. Like the
          change at our birth&mdash;which produced not a suspension of the faculties
          we had before, nor a <em>total</em> change in our state of life; but a continuance
          of both, with great alterations.</li>
          <li class="consp">4.) Death may but at once put us into a <em>higher</em> state of life, as our birth
          did; our relation to bodily organs may be the only hinderance to our
          entering a higher condition of the reflective powers.</li>
          <li class="consp">5.) Were we even sure that death would suspend our intellectual powers, it
          would not furnish even the lowest probability that it would destroy
          them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> From the analogy of plants.
    <ul>
    <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> This furnishes poets with apt illustrations of our frailty, but affords no
    proper analogy. Plants are destitute of perception and action, and
    this is the very matter in question.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>REMARKS.</h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It has been shown, that confining ourselves to what we know, we see no
  probability of ever ceasing to be:&mdash;it cannot be concluded from the reason
  of the thing:&mdash;nor from the analogy of nature.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> We are therefore to go upon the belief of a future existence.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Our going into <em>new scenes</em> and conditions, is just as natural as our coming
  into the world.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Our condition may naturally be a social one.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> The advantages of it may naturally be bestowed, according to some fixed
  law, in proportion to one’s degrees in virtue.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Perhaps not so much as now <em>by society</em>; but by God’s more immediate
      action.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Yet this will be no less <em>natural</em>, <i>i.e.</i> stated, fixed, or settled.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Our notions of what is natural, are enlarged by greater knowledge of God
      and his works.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) There may be some beings in the world, to whom the whole of Christianity
      is as natural as the visible course of nature seems to us.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> These probabilities of a future life, though they do not satisfy curiosity,
  answer all the purposes of religion, as well as demonstration.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Even a demonstration of a future state, would not demonstrate religion,
      but would be reconcilable with atheism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></li>
      <li class="consp">2.) But as religion implies a future state, any presumption against such a
      state, would be a presumption against religion.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The foregoing observations remove all presumptions of that sort, and
      prove to a great probability, a fundamental doctrine of religion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD BY REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.</span></h4>

<p>The question of a future life is rendered momentous by our capacity for
happiness and misery.</p>

<p>Especially if that happiness or misery depends on our present conduct.</p>

<p>We should feel the deepest solicitude on this subject.</p>

<p>And that if there were no proof of a future life and interest, other than the
probabilities just discussed.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>In the present world our pleasures and pains are, to a great extent,
in our own power.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> We see them to be consequences of our actions.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> And we can <em>foresee</em> these consequences.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Our desires are not gratified, without the right kind of exertion.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> By prudence we may enjoy life; rashness, or even neglect may make us
  miserable.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Why this is so is another matter.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) It may be impossible to be otherwise.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Or it may be best on the whole.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Or God’s plan may be to make only the good happy.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Or the whole plan may be incomprehensible to us.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> It may be said “this is only the course of nature.”
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> It is granted: but
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1. The course of nature is but the will of God. We admit that God is the
          natural governor of the world: and must not turn round and deny it
          because his government is <em>uniform</em>.</li>
          <li class="consp">2. Our natural foresight of the consequences of actions, is his appointment.</li>
          <li class="consp">3. The consequences themselves, are his appointment.</li>
          <li class="consp">4. Our ability to foresee these consequences, is God’s <em>instruction</em> how we are
          to act.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> By this reasoning we are instructed to gratify our appetites, and such
  gratification is our reward for so doing.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> Certainly not. Foreseen pleasures and pains are proper motives to action
      <em>in general</em>; but we may, in particular cases, damage ourselves by
      indulgence. Our eyes are made to see with, but not to look at every
      thing:&mdash;for instance the sun.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It follows, from what has been said, that</p>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>We are, now, actually under God’s government, in the strictest
sense.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Admitting that there is a God, it is not so much a matter of speculation, as
  of experience, that he governs us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The annexing of pleasures and pains to certain actions, and giving notice
  them, is the very essence of government.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Whether by direct acts upon us, or by contriving a general plan, does not
  affect the argument.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) If magistrates could make laws which should <em>execute themselves</em>, their
      government would be far more perfect than it is.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) God’s making fire burn us, is as much an instance of government, as if
      he <em>directly inflicted</em> the burn, whenever we touched fire.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Hence the analogy of nature shows nothing to render incredible the Bible
  doctrine of God’s rewarding or punishing according to our actions.</li>
</ul>

<h5><i>Additional remarks on Punishment.</i></h5>

<p>As men object chiefly to future punishment, it is proper to show further that
the course of administration, as to <em>present</em> punishment, is analogous to what
religion teaches as to <em>the future</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed they add credibility to it.</p>

<p>And ought to raise the most serious apprehension.</p>

<h6 class="sub">I. <i>Circumstances to be observed touching present punishments.</i></h6>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> They often follow acts which produce present pleasure or advantage.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The sufferings often far exceed the pleasure or advantage.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> They often follow remotely.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> After long delay they often come suddenly.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> As those remote effects are not certainly foreseen, they may not be thought
  of at the time; or if so, there is a hope of escaping.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> There are opportunities of advantage, which if neglected do not recur.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>7.</b> Though, in some cases, men who have sinned up to a certain point, may
  retrieve their affairs, yet in many cases, reformation is of no avail.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>8.</b> Inconsiderateness is often as disastrous as wilful wrong-doing.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>9.</b> As some punishments by civil government, are capital, so are some natural
  punishments.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Seem intended to remove the offender out of the way.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Or as an example to others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 class="sub">II. <i>These things are not accidental, but proceed from fixed laws.</i></h6>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> They are matters of daily experience.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Proceed from the general laws, by which the world is governed.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="sub">III. <i>They so closely resemble what religion teaches, as to future punishment,
that both might be expressed in the same words.</i></h6>

<p><i>e.g.</i> Proverbs, ch. i.</p>

<p>The analogy sufficiently answers all objections against the Scripture doctrine
of future punishment, such as</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp">1.) That our frailty or temptations annihilate the guilt of vice.</li>
  <li class="consp">2.) Or the objection from necessity.</li>
  <li class="consp">3.) Or that the Almighty cannot be contradicted.</li>
  <li class="consp">4.) Or that he cannot be offended.</li>
</ul>

<h5>REMARKS.</h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Such reflections are terrific, but ought to be stated and considered.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Disregard of a hereafter cannot be justified by any thing short of a
  <em>demonstration</em> of atheism. Even skeptical doctrines afford no justification.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> There is no pretence of reason for presuming that the licentious will not
  find it better for them that they had never been born.</li>

<h4>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD.</span></h4>

<p>As the structure of the world shows <em>intelligence</em>, so the mode of distributing
pleasure and pain, shows government. That is, God’s <em>natural</em> government,
such as a king exercises over his subjects.</p>

<p>But this does not, at first sight, determine what is the <em>moral character</em> of
such government.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>What is a moral or righteous government?</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Not mere rewarding and punishing.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> But doing this according to character.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> The perfection of moral government is doing this <em>exactly</em>.</li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> God is simply and absolutely benevolent.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> Benevolence, infinite in degree, would dispose him to produce the greatest
      possible happiness, regardless of behaviour. This would rob God of
      other attributes; and should not be asserted unless it can be proved.
      And whether it can be proved is not the point now in hand.</li>
      <li class="consp">The question is not whether there may not be, in the universe, beings to
      whom he manifests absolute benevolence, which might not be incompatible with
      justice; but whether he treats <em>us</em> so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> It must be owned to be vastly difficult, in such a disordered world, to estimate
  with exactness the overplus of happiness on the side of virtue: and
  there may be exceptions to the rule. But it is far from being doubtful
  that <em>on the whole</em>, virtue is happier than vice, in this world.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>The beginnings of a righteous administration, are seen in nature.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It has been proved (ch. ii.) that God <em>governs</em>: and it is reasonable to suppose
  that he would govern <em>righteously</em>.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Any other rule of government would be harder to account for.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) The Bible doctrine that hereafter the good shall be happy, and the
      wicked miserable, is no more than an expectation that a method of
      government, now begun, shall be carried on.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The opposite consequences of prudence and rashness, show a right constitution
  of nature; and our ability to foresee and control these consequences,
  shows that we are under moral law.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> God has so constructed society that vice, to a great degree, is actually
  punished by it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Without this, society could not exist.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) This is God’s government, through society; and is as <em>natural</em>, as society.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Since the course of things is God’s appointment, men are unavoidably
      accountable for their behaviour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> Society often punishes good actions, and rewards wickedness.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. This is not <em>necessary</em>, and consequently not natural.</li>
      <li class="consp">2. Good actions are never punished by society as <em>good</em>, but because
      considered bad.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> By the course of nature, virtue is rewarded, and vice punished, <em>as such</em>,
  which proves a moral government; as will be seen if we rightly distinguish
  between actions and their qualities.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) An action may produce present gratification though it be wrong: in
      which case the gratification is in the act, not the morality of it: in other
      cases the enjoyment consists wholly in the quality of virtuousness.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Vice is naturally attended with uneasiness, apprehension, vexation,
      remorse, &amp;c.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;This is a very different feeling from that produced by mere misfortune.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Men comfort themselves under misfortune, that it was not their own fault.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Honest and good men are befriended <em>as such</em>.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Injuries are resented as implying fault; and good offices are regarded
      with gratitude on account of the <em>intention</em>, even when they fail to benefit us.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;This is seen in family government, where children are punished for
          falsehood, fretfulness, &amp;c., though no one is hurt.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;And also in civil government, where the absence or presence of ill
          intention goes far in determining the penalty of wrong-doing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">5.) The whole course of the world, in all ages and relations, turns much upon
      approbation and disapprobation.</li>
      <li class="consp">6.) The very fact of our having a moral nature, is a proof of our being
      under God’s moral government.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;We are placed in a condition which unavoidably operates on our moral
          nature.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Hence it arises that reward to virtue and reprobation of vice, as such,
          is a <em>rule</em>, never inverted. If it be thought that there are instances
          to the contrary, (which is not so,) they are evidently monstrous.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The <em>degree</em> in which virtue and vice receive proper returns, is not the
          question now, but only the thing itself, in some degree.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">7.) It is admitted that virtue sometimes suffers, and vice prospers; but this
      is <em>disorder</em>, and not the order of nature.</li>
      <li class="consp">8.) It follows, that we have in the government of the world, a declaration
      from God, for virtue and against vice. So far as a man is true to virtue,
      is he on the side of the divine administration. Such a man must have
      a <em>sense of security</em>, and a hope of <em>something better</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> This hope is confirmed by observing that virtue has necessary tendencies
  beyond their present effects.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) These are very obvious with regard to individuals.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Are as real, though not so patent, in regard to society.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The power of a society under the direction of virtue, tends to prevail
          over power not so directed, just as power under direction of reason,
          tends to prevail over brute force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;As this may not be conceded, we will notice how the case stands,
          as to reason:
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">· Length of time, and proper opportunity, are necessary for reason
              to triumph over brutes.</li>
              <li class="consp">· Rational beings, disunited, envious, unjust, and treacherous, may
              be overcome by brutes, uniting themselves by instinct: but this
              would be an inverted order of things.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;A like tendency has virtue to produce superiority.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">· By making the good of society, the object of every member of it.</li>
              <li class="consp">· By making every one industrious in his own sphere.</li>
              <li class="consp">· By uniting all in one bond of veracity and justice.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">3.) If the part of God’s government which we see, and the part we do
      not see, make up one scheme, then we see a <em>tendency</em> in virtue to
      superiority.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) But to <em>produce</em> that superiority there must be
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;A force proportioned to the obstacles.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Sufficient lapse of time.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;A fair field of trial; such as extent of time, adequate occasions, and
          opportunities for the virtuous to unite.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">5.) These things are denied to virtue in this life, so that its tendencies,
      though real, are <em>hindered</em>.</li>
      <li class="consp">6.) But it may have all requisite advantages hereafter.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Eternity will be lasting enough.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Good men will unite; as they cannot do now, scattered over the earth,
          and ignorant of one another.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Other orders of virtuous beings will join; for the very nature of virtue
          is a bond of union.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">7.) The tendency of such an order of things, so far as seen by vicious beings
      in any part of the universe, would be to the amendment of all who
      were capable of it, and their recovery to virtue.</li>
      <li class="consp">8.) All this goes to show that the hinderances to virtue are contingent, and
      that its beneficial tendencies are God’s declarations in its favor.</li>
      <li class="consp">9.) If the preceding considerations are thought to be too speculative, we
      may easily come to the same result by reflecting on the supremacy
      which any earthly nation would attain, by entire virtue for many ages.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>REMARKS.</h5>

<p>Consider now the general system of religion. The government of the world
is one; it is moral; virtue shall in the end prevail over wickedness; and to
see the importance and fitness of such an arrangement we have only to
consider what would be the state of things, if vice had these advantages, or
virtue the contrary.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> Why may not things be now going on in other worlds, and continue
  always to go on in this world, in the same mixed and disordered
  state as at present?
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> We are not proving that God’s moral government is <em>perfect</em>, or the truth
      of religion, but only seeing what there is in the course of nature, to
      confirm it, supposing it to be known. Were there nothing to judge by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
      but the present distribution of pleasure and pain, we should have no
      ground to conclude that hereafter we should be rewarded or punished
      exactly according to our deserts. But even then there would be no
      indication that vice is better than virtue. Still the preceding observations
      <em>confirm</em> the doctrine of future retribution; for,
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) They show that the Author of nature is not indifferent to virtue
          and vice.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) That future distributive justice would differ not in <em>kind</em>, but in degree
          only, from God’s present government. It would be the <em>effect</em>, towards
          which we see the <em>tendency</em>.</li>
          <li class="consp">3.) That higher rewards and punishments <em>may be</em> hereafter.</li>
          <li class="consp">4.) That we should <em>expect</em> it to be so; because the tendencies of vice and
          virtue are immutable, while the hinderances are only artificial.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h5>SUMMARY.</h5>

<p>[This enumerates the steps of the argument, in the foregoing chapter, in
as condensed a form as possible.]</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">OF A STATE OF PROBATION.</span></h4>

<p>The doctrine of probation comprehends several particulars. But the most
common notion is that our future interests are <em>depending</em>; and depending on
<em>ourselves</em>. And that we have <em>opportunities</em> for both good and bad conduct,
and <em>temptations</em> to each.</p>

<p>This is not exactly the same as our being under moral government; for it
implies allurement to evil, and difficulties in being good.</p>

<p>Hence needs to be considered by itself.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Doctrine.</i> <span class="smcap">The natural government of God, in this world, puts us on
trial as to the things of this world; and so implies, what
religion teaches, that his moral government puts us on
trial as to a future world.</span></p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>So far as we are tempted to do what will damage our future temporal
interests, so far we are under probation as to those interests.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> The annexing of pleasures and pains to actions, as good or bad, and
  enabling us to foresee their effect, implies that our interests, in part at
  least, depend on ourselves.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> We often <em>blame</em> ourselves and others for evils, as resulting from misconduct.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> It is very certain that we often miss possible good, and incur evils, not for
  want of knowing better, but through our <em>fault</em>.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Every one speaks of the hazards of young persons, from other causes
  than ignorance.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>These natural or temporal trials are analogous to our moral
and religious trial.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> In both cases, what constitutes the trial, is either in our circumstances
  or in our nature.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Some would do right but for violent or extraordinary temptations.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Others will <em>seek</em> evil, and go out of their way after wicked indulgence,
      when there are no external temptations.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) But even those who err through temptation, must have that within which
      makes them <em>susceptible</em> of temptation.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) So that we are in a like state of probation with respect to both present
      and future interests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> If we proceed to observe how mankind behave in both capacities, we see
      the same analogy.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Some scarcely look beyond the present gratification.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Some are driven by their passions against their better judgment and
      feeble resolutions.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Some shamelessly go on in open vice.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Some persist in wrong-doing, even under strong apprehensions of future
      misery.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> The analogy is no less plain in regard to the influence of others upon us.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Bad example.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Wrong education.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Corruptions of religion.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) General prevalence of mistakes as to true happiness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> In both cases negligence and folly bring difficulty as well as vice.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>The disadvantages we labor under from our fallen and disordered
state, are the same, in relation to both earthly and future interests.</i></h5>

<p>This disadvantage affords no ground of complaint; for,</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> We <em>may</em> manage to pass our days in comfort and peace.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> And so may we obtain the security and comfort of religion.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> We might as well complain that we are not a higher order of beings.</li>
</ul>

<h5>REMARKS.</h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It is thus proved that the state of trial, which religion says we are in, is
  credible; for it exactly corresponds to what we see.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) If from birth till death we were in a constant security of enjoyment,
      without care or correctness, it would be a presumption against religion.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) It might, if we had no experience, be urged that an infinitely good Being
      would not expose us to the hazard of misery. This is indeed a difficulty,
      and must remain so; but still the course of nature is as it is.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The miseries which we bring on ourselves are no more unavoidable than
      our deportment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> It has been proved that we are in danger of miscarrying as to our interests,
  both present and future.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> The sum of the whole is, that as we do not have present enjoyments and
  honors forced upon us, in spite of misconduct, so this <em>may</em> be the case,
  as to that chief and final good which religion proposes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">PROBATION INTENDED FOR MORAL DISCIPLINE AND IMPROVEMENT.</span></h4>

<p>Why we should be placed in the condition spoken of in the last chapter, is
a question which cannot be answered. It may be that we could not understand,
if told. And if we could, it might injure us to know, just now. It
certainly is consistent with God’s righteous government.</p>

<p>Religion tells us that we are so placed in order to become qualified for
a better state.</p>

<p>This, though a very partial answer to the inquiry <em>why</em> we are so placed,
answers an infinitely more important question,&mdash;viz.: <em>What is our business
here?</em></p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>We are placed in this state of trial, for our improvement in
virtue, as the requisite qualification for future security and
happiness.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Every creature is designed for a particular way of life.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Happiness depends on the congruity between a creature’s nature and its
      circumstances.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Man’s character might be so changed as to make him <em>incapable</em> of
      happiness on earth.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Or he might be placed, without changing his nature, in a world where he
      must be wretched, for want of the proper objects to answer to his
      desires.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) So that without determining what is the future condition of good men,
      we know there must be necessary <em>qualifications</em> to make us capable of
      enjoying it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Human beings are so constituted as to become fit for new and different
  conditions.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) We not only acquire ideas, but store them up.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) We can become more expert in any kind of action.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) And can make settled alterations in our tempers.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) We can form <em>habits</em>&mdash;both bodily and mental.</li>
      <li class="consp">As these operate in producing radical changes in human character, we will
      look for a moment at the process.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Neither perceptions, nor knowledge, are habits; though necessary to
          <em>forming</em> them.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;There are habits of perception, however, and habits of action: the
          former are passive, the latter active.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Habits of body are produced by external acts, and habits of mind by
          the exertion of principles; <i>i.e.</i> carrying them out.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Resolutions to do well are acts, and may <em>help</em> towards forming
          good habits. But <em>mere</em> theorizing, and forming pictures in the
          mind, not only do not help, but may harden the mind to a
          contrary course.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Passive impressions, by repetition grow weaker. Thus familiarity with

          <li class="consp">&mdash;Hence active habits may be formed and strengthened, by acting according
          to certain motives or excitements, which grow less sensibly felt
          and less and less felt, as the habit strengthens.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">· Thus the sight of distress excites the passive emotion of pity,
              and the active principle of benevolence. But inquiring out
              cases of distress in order to relieve them, causes diminished
              sensitiveness at the sight of misery, and stronger benevolence
              and aptitude in relieving it.</li>
              <li class="consp">· So admonition, experience, and example, if acted upon, produce
              good; if not, harden.</li>

      </li>
      <li class="consp">5.) The formation of a habit may be imperceptible and even inexplicable,
      but the thing itself is matter of certain experience.</li>
      <li class="consp">6.) A habit once formed, the action becomes easy and often pleasurable:
      opposite inclinations grow weaker: difficulties less: and occasions more
      frequent.</li>
      <li class="consp">7.) Thus, a new character, in several respects, is formed.</li>

  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> We should not have these capacities for improvement and for the reconstruction
  of character, if it were not necessary.

        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;We are not qualified, at first, for mature life: understanding and
          strength come gradually.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;If we had them in full, at birth, we should at first be distracted
          and bewildered, and our faculties would be of no use previous to
          experience. Ignorant of any employment, we could not provide
          for ourselves.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;So that man is an unformed, unfinished creature, even as to this world,

          things we are averse to.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;According as we act during this formative period, is our character

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Our state of discipline throughout this life, for another, is exactly of the
      same kind: and comprehended under one general law.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;If we could not see how the present discipline fitted us for a higher
          life, it would be no objection.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">· We do not know how food, sleep, &amp;c. enlarges the child’s body;

  need of the moral culture of our present state.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Analogy indicates that our future state will be social.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Nature furnishes no shadow of unreasonableness in the Scripture
          doctrine that this future community will be under the more immediate
          government of God.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Nor the least proof that its members will not require the exercise of
          veracity, justice, &amp;c. towards each other; and that character which
          <em>results</em> from the practice of such virtues.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Certainly the universe is under moral government; and a virtuous
          character must, in some way, be a condition of happiness in that
          state.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">2.) We are deficient, and in danger of deviating from what is right.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;We have desires for outward objects.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The times, degrees, &amp;c. of gratifying these desires, are, of right, subject
          to the control of the moral principle.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;But that principle neither excites them, nor prevents their being
          excited.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;They may exist, when they cannot be lawfully gratified, or gratified
          at all.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;When the desire exists, and the gratification is unlawful, we are
          tempted.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The only security is the principle within.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The strengthening of this lessens the danger.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;It may be strengthened, by discipline and exercise.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">· Noting examples.</li>
              <li class="consp">· Attending to the right, and not to preference.</li>
              <li class="consp">· Considering our true interests.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;When improved, it becomes, in proportion to its strength, our security
          from the dangers of natural propensions.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Virtue, become habitual by discipline, is improved virtue; and improved
          virtue must produce increased happiness, if the government
          of the world is moral.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Even creatures made upright may fall.
      <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The fall of an upright being, is not accounted for by the nature of
          liberty; for that would only be saying that an event happened
          because it might happen.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;But from the very nature of propensions.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;A finitely perfect being would have propensions corresponding to its
          surroundings; its understanding; and its moral sense; and all these
          in due proportions.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Such a being would have propensions, though the object might not
          be present, or the indulgence might be contrary to its moral sense;
          and this would have some tendency, however small, to induce
          gratification.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The tendency would be increased by the frequency of occasions; and
          yet more by the least indulgence, even in thought; till, under peculiar
          conjunctures, it would become effect.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The first transgression might so utterly disorder the constitution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
          change the proportions of forces, as to lead to a repetition of irregularities;
          and hence to the construction of bad habits, and a depraved
          character.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">5.) On the contrary, a finitely perfect being may attain higher virtue, and
      more security, by obeying the moral principle.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;For the danger would lessen, by the increased submissiveness of
          propensions.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The moral principle would gain force by exercise.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">6.) Thus vice is not only criminal, but degrading; and virtue is not only
      right, but improving.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The degree of improvement may be such that the danger of sinning
          may be almost infinitely lessened.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Yet the security may always be the habits formed in a state of discipline;
          making such a state altogether fit and necessary.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">7.) This course of reasoning is vastly stronger when applied to fallen and
      corrupt creatures.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The upright need improvement; the fallen must be renewed.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Discipline is expedient for the one; necessary for the other; and of a
          severer sort.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>The present world is peculiarly fit for such discipline as we need.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Surrounding evils tend to produce moderation, practical knowledge, &amp;c.
  very different from a mere speculative knowledge of our liability to vice
  and misery.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Our experience in this world, with right views and practice, may leave
  eternal impressions for good.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Every act of self-government in the exercise of virtue, must, from the very
  make of our nature, form habits of virtue, and a more intense virtuous
  principle.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Resolute and persevering resistance to particular and violent temptations, is
  a <em>continued</em> act of virtue, and that in a <em>higher degree</em> than if the seduction
  were transient and weak.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Self-denial is not essential to virtue, but is almost essential to discipline and
  improvement.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Because actions materially virtuous, which have no difficulty, but agree
      with our inclinations, may be done merely from inclination, and so not
      be <em>really</em> virtuous.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) But when they are done in face of danger and difficulty, virtuousness is
      increased, and confirmed into a habit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 1. As our intellectual or physical powers may be overtasked, so may our moral.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> This may be so in exceptional cases, but it does not confute the argument.
      In general, it holds good. All that is intended to be proved is, that this
      world is <em>intended</em> to be a state of improvement, and is <em>fitted</em> for it.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) Some sciences which of themselves are highly improving, require a
          trying measure of attention, which some will not submit to.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) It is admitted that this world disciplines many to vice: but this viciousness
          of many is the very thing which makes the world a virtuous
          discipline to good men. The <em>whole end</em> in placing mankind as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
          are we know not; but these things are evident&mdash;the virtues of some
          are exercised:&mdash;and so exercised as to be improved: and improved
          beyond what they would be in a perfectly virtuous community.</li>
          <li class="consp">3.) That all, or even the generality, do not improve, is no proof that their
          improvement was not <em>intended</em>. Of seeds and animals not one in a
          million comes to perfection; yet such as do, evidently answer an end
          for which they were designed. The <em>appearance of waste</em> in regard to
          seeds, &amp;c. is just as unaccountable, as the ruin of moral agents.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 2. Rectitude arising from hope and fear, is only the discipline of
  self-love.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> Obedience <em>is</em> obedience, though prompted by hope or fear: and a <em>course</em>
      of such obedience, forms a habit of it: and distinct habits of various
      virtues, by repressing inclination whenever justice, veracity, &amp;c.
      require.<br />
      <span class="sub-line">Beside, veracity, justice, regard to God’s authority, and self-interest, are
      coincident; and each, separately, a just principle. To begin a good
      life from either of them, and persist, produces that very character
      which corresponds to our relations to God, and secures happiness.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 3. The virtues requisite for a state of afflictions, and produced by it, are
  not wanted to qualify us for a state of happiness.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> Such is not the verdict of experience. Passive submission is essential to
      right character. Prosperity itself begets extravagant desires; and
      imagination may produce as much discontent as actual condition.
      Hence, though we may not need <em>patience</em> in heaven, we shall need that
      <em>temper</em> which is formed by patience.<br />
      <span class="sub-line">Self-love would always coincide with God’s commands, when our interest
      was rightly understood; but it is liable to error. Therefore, <span class="smcapuc">HABITS</span> of

      for resignation is affliction.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 4. The trouble and danger of such discipline, might have been avoided
  by making us at once, what we are intended to become.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> What we are to be, is the effect of what we are to do. God’s natural
      government is arranged not to save us from trouble or danger, but to
      enable and incline us to go through them. It is as natural for us to
      seek means to obtain things, as it is to seek the things; and in worldly
      things we are left to our choice, whether to improve our powers and so
      better our condition, or to neglect improvement and so go without the
      advantage.<br />
      <span class="sub-line">Analogy, therefore, makes the same arrangement credible, as to a future

<h4>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">OF NECESSITY AS INFLUENCING CONDUCT.</span></h4>

<p>Fatalists have no right to object to Christianity, for they of course hold
the doctrine to be compatible with what they see in nature.</p>

<p>The question is, whether it be not equally compatible with what Christianity
teaches.</p>

<p>To argue on the supposition of so great an absurdity as necessity, is puzzling;
and the obscurity and puzzle of the argument must therefore be excused.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>Necessity does not destroy the proof of an intelligent Author and
Governor of the world.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It does not exclude design and deliberation.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) This is matter of actual experience and consciousness.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Necessity does not account for the <em>existence</em> of any thing, but is only a
          <em>circumstance</em> relating to its origin. Instance the case of a house:
          the fatalist admits that it had a builder, and the only question would
          be, was he obliged to build it as he did?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">2.) It is the same as to the construction of the world. To say it exists by
      necessity must mean it had a maker, who <em>acted</em> by necessity: for
      necessity is only an abstract notion, and can <em>do</em> nothing.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) We say God exists by necessity, because we intuitively discern that there
      must be an infinite Being, prior to all causes; but we cannot say that
      <em>every thing</em> so exists. The fact that many changes in nature are produced
      by man’s contrivance is a proof of this.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Thus though the fatalist does not choose to mean by necessity <em>an agent
      acting necessarily</em>, he is obliged to mean this.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) And it also follows that a thing’s being done by necessity does not exclude
      <em>design</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> It does not exclude a belief that we are in a state of religion.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Suppose a fatalist to educate a child on his own principles,&mdash;viz.: that
      he cannot do otherwise than he does; and is not subject to praise or
      blame.
      <span class="sub-line">(It might be asked, <em>would</em> he, if possessed of common sense, so educate
      his child?)</span>
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The child would be delighted with his freedom; but would soon prove
          a pest, and go to destruction.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;He would meet with checks and rebuffs, which would teach him that he
          <em>was</em> accountable.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;He would, in the end, be convinced either that his doctrine was wrong,
          or that he had reasoned inconclusively upon it, and misapplied it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">2.) To apply fatalism to practice, in any other way, would be found equally
      fallacious: <i>e.g.</i> that he need not take care of his life.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) No such absurdity follows the doctrine of freedom.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Reasoning on this ground is justified by all experience.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The constitution of things is <em>as if</em> we were free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">4.) If the doctrine of necessity be true, and yet, when we <em>apply it</em> to life,
      always misleads us; how, then, can we be sure it would not mislead us
      with respect to future interests?</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) It follows that if there are proofs of religion on the supposition of freedom,
      they are just as conclusive on the supposition of necessity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> It does not refute the notion that God has a will and a character.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) It does not hinder <em>us</em> from having a will and a character; from being
      cruel, or benevolent, or just, &amp;c.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) If necessity be plead as the excuse for crime, it equally excuses the
      <em>punishment</em> of crime; for if it destroys the sin of the one, it destroys
      the sin of the other.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The very assumption of injustice in punishing crime, shows that we cannot
      rid ourselves of the notion of justice and injustice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> If necessity be <em>reconcilable</em> with the character of God, as portrayed in
  Christianity, does it not destroy <em>the proof</em> that he has that character;
  and so destroy the proofs of religion?
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> No. Happiness and misery are not our fate, but the results of our conduct.
      God’s government is that of a father and a magistrate; and his
      natural rule of government must be veracity and justice. We shall
      proceed to show that,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>Necessity does not destroy the proofs of religion.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It is a plain fact that God rewards and punishes.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) He has given us a moral faculty, by which we discern between actions,
      and approve or disapprove, &amp;c.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) This implies a <em>rule</em>, a peculiar <em>kind</em> of rule; <i>i.e.</i> one from which we
      cannot depart without being self-condemned.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The dictates of our moral faculty are God’s laws, with sanctions. It not
      only raises a sense of <em>duty</em>, but a sense of <em>security</em> in obeying, and
      danger in disobeying; and this is an explicit sanction.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) God’s government must conform to the nature he has given us; and we
      must infer that in the upshot happiness will follow virtue, and misery
      vice.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) Hence religious worship is a duty, if only as a means of keeping up the
      sense of this government.</li>
      <li class="consp">6.) No objection from necessity can lie against this course of proof.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The conclusion is wholly and directly from facts; not from what

  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Natural religion has external evidence which necessity, if true, does not

          <li class="consp">&mdash;And either that it was revealed, or forces itself upon the mind.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The rude state of the early ages leads to the belief of its being

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Early pretences to revelation indicate some original real one from which

      <li class="consp">&mdash;Such a fact is a proof of religion, against which there is no presumption.</li>
      <li class="consp">&mdash;And indicates a revelation prior to the examination of the book said
      to contain it; and independent of all considerations of its being
      corrupted, or darkened by fables.</li>

  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> It is thus apparent that the <em>external</em> evidence of religion is considerable;

<h5>REMARKS.</h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp">1. The danger of taking custom, &amp;c. for our moral rule.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) We are all liable to prejudice.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Reason may be impaired, perverted, or disregarded.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The matter in hand is of infinite moment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp">2. The foregoing observations amount to practical proof.</li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> Probabilities which cannot be confuted, may be overbalanced by
  greater probabilities: much more by demonstration. Now, as the
  doctrine of necessity must be true, it cannot be that God governs us
  as if we were free when he knows we are not.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> This brings the matter to a point, and the answer is not to be evaded,&mdash;viz.:
      that the whole constitution and course of things shows this
      reasoning to be false, be the fallacy where it may.<br />
      <span class="sub-line">The doctrine of freedom shows where,&mdash;viz.: in supposing ourselves necessary
      agents when in fact we are free.</span><br />
      <span class="sub-line">Admitting the doctrine of necessity, the fallacy evidently lies in denying
      that necessary agents are accountable; for that they <em>are</em> rewarded and
      punished is undeniable.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;It follows that necessity, if true, neither proves that God will
not make his creatures happy or miserable according to their conduct, nor
destroys the proofs that he will do so. That is, necessity, practically, is
false.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">DIVINE GOVERNMENT A SCHEME IMPERFECTLY COMPREHENDED.</span></h4>

<p>Moral government, <em>as a fact</em>, has now been considered; it remains for us
to remove objections against its <em>wisdom and goodness</em>. A thing being true
does not prove it to be good.</p>

<p>In arguing as to its truth, analogy could only show it to be credible. But, if
a moral government be admitted as a fact, analogy makes it credible that it is
a scheme or system, and that man’s comprehension of it is necessarily so
limited, as to be inadequate to determine its injustice.</p>

<p>This we shall find to be the case.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Doctrine.</i> <span class="smcap">On the supposition that God exercises moral government,
the analogy of nature teaches that it must be a scheme,
and one quite beyond our comprehension.</span></p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>The ordering of nature is a scheme; and makes it credible by
analogy, that moral government is a scheme.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> The parts curiously correspond to each other; individuals to individuals,
  species to species, events to events; and all these both immediate and
  remote.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> This correspondence embraces all the past, and all the future; including
  all creatures, actions, and events.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) There is no event, which does not depend for its occurrence on some
      further thing, unknown to us; we cannot give the whole account of
      any one thing.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Things apparently the most insignificant, seem to be necessary to others,
      of the greatest importance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> If such is God’s natural government, it is credible that such is his moral
  government.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) In fact they are so blended as to make one scheme.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;One is subservient to the other, just as the vegetable kingdom subserves
          the animal, and our animal organization subserves our mental.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Every act of God seems to look beyond the occasion, and to have
          reference to a general plan.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;There is evidently a previous adjustment.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp">· The periods, &amp;c. for trying men.</li>
              <li class="consp">· The instruments of justice.</li>
              <li class="consp">· The kinds of retribution.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">2.) The whole comprises a system, a very small part of which is known to
      us: therefore no objections against any part can be insisted on.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) This ignorance is universally acknowledged, except in arguing against
      religion. That it ought to be a valid answer to objections against
      religion, we proceed to show.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Suppose it to be asserted that all evils might have been prevented by
          repeated interpositions; or that more good might have been so produced;
          which would be the utmost that could be said: still,</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Our ignorance would vindicate religion from any objections arising
          from apparent disorders in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;The government of the world might be <em>good</em>, even on those suppositions;
          for at most they could but suggest that it might be <em>better</em>.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;At any rate, they are mere assertions.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Instances may be alleged, in things much less out of reach, of suppositions
          palpably impossible, which <em>all</em> do not see to be so: nor <em>any,
          at first sight</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">4.) It follows that our ignorance is a satisfactory answer to all objections
      against the divine government.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;An objection against an act of Providence, no way connected with
          any other thing, as being unjust, could not be answered by our
          ignorance.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;But when the objection is made against an act related to other and
          unknown acts, then our ignorance is a full answer.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Some unknown relation, or unknown impossibility, may render the act
          not only good, but good in the highest degree.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>Consider some particular things, in the natural government of
God, the like of which we may infer, by analogy, to be contained

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> No ends are accomplished without means.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Often, means very disagreeable bring the most desirable results.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) How means produce ends, is not learned by reason, but experience.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) In many cases, before experience, we should have expected contrary
      results.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Hence we may infer that those things which are objected against God’s
      moral government, produce good.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) It is evident that our not seeing <em>how</em> the means work good, or their
      seeming to have an opposite effect, offers no presumption against their
      fitness to work good.</li>
      <li class="consp">6.) They may not only be fit, but the <em>only</em> means of ultimate good.</li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> Though our capacity of vice and misery may promote virtue, and <em>our</em>
      suffering for sin be better than if we were restrained by force, yet it
      would have been better if evil had not entered the world.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> It is granted that though sinful acts may produce benefits, to refrain
          from them would produce more. We have curative pains, yet pain is
          not better than health.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Natural government is carried on by general laws.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Nature shows that this is best: all the good we enjoy is because there
      are general laws. They enable us to <em>forecast</em> for the procurement of good.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) It may not be possible, by general laws, to prevent all irregularities, or
      remedy them.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Direct interpositions might perhaps remedy many disorders arising

    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. Total ignorance of a subject precludes argument, but partial ignorance
      does not. We may, in various degrees, know a man’s character, and
      the way he is <em>likely</em> to pursue certain ends; and yet not know how he
      <em>ought</em> to act to gain those ends. In this case objections to his mode
      of pursuing ends may be answered by our ignorance, though that he
      <em>does</em> act in a certain manner is capable of proof. So we may have
      evidence of God’s character and aims, and yet not be competent judges
      as to his measures. Our ignorance is a good answer to the difficulties
      of religion, but no objection to religion itself.</li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 2. If our ignorance did invalidate the proofs of religion, as well as the
      objections, yet is it undeniable that moral obligations remain unaffected
      by our ignorance of the consequences of obedience or violation.
      The consequences of vice and virtue may not be fully known,
      yet it is credible that they may be such as religion declares: and this
      credibility is an obligation, in point of prudence, to abstain from sin.</li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 3. Our answers to the objections against religion, are <em>not</em> equally valid
      against the proofs of it.</li>
      <li class="consp">[Answers rehearsed.]</li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 4. Our answers, though they may be said to be based on our ignorance,
      are really not so, but on what analogy teaches <em>concerning</em> our ignorance,&mdash;viz.:
      that it renders us incompetent judges. They are based
      on experience, and what we <em>do know</em>; so that to credit religion is to
      trust to experience, and to disregard it is the contrary.</li>

<h5>CONCLUSION.</h5>

  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> The reasoning of the last chapter leads us to regard this life as part of a
  larger plan of things.

      uncertain; but it is very clear we are connected, more or less, with

  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> This scheme contains as much that is wonderful as religion does: for
  it certainly would be as wonderful that all nature came into existence
  without a Creator, as that there should be a Creator: and as wonderful
  that the Creator should act without any rule or scheme, as that he should
  act with one; or that he should act by a bad rule, rather than a righteous
  one.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Our very nature compels us to believe that the will and character of the
  Author of nature, is just and good.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Whatever be his character, he formed the world as it is, and controls it as
  he does, and has assigned us our part and lot.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Irrational creatures act their part, and receive their lot, without reflection,

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">IMPORTANCE OF CHRISTIANITY.</span></h4>

<p>Every one must admit that we <em>need</em> a revelation. Few, if any, could reason
out a system, even of natural religion. If they could, there is no probability
that they would. Such as might, would still feel the want of revelation. To
say that Christianity is superfluous, is as wild as to say all are happy.</p>

<p>No exactness in attending to natural religion can make Christianity of small
importance.</p>

<p>If Christianity be from God, we must obey, unless we know all his reasons
for giving it: and also that those reasons no longer exist; at least in our case.
This we cannot know.</p>

<p>The importance of Christianity appears if we regard it</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>As a republication of natural religion.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It gives the moral system of the universe.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Free from corruptions; teaching that
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Jehovah created all things.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;” governs all things.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Virtue is his law.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Mankind will be judged according to character.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">2.) It publishes its facts authoritatively.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) With vastly more clearness; e.g. the doctrines of a future state: danger
      of sin: efficacy of repentance.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) With the advantage of a visible church, distinguished from the world by
      peculiar institutions.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> The perversions of Christianity, and the little good it has done.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. Natural religion is no less perverted, and has done less good.</li>
              <li class="consp">2. The benefits of Christianity are <em>not</em> small.</li>
              <li class="consp">3. The evils ascribed to it, are not <em>its</em> effects. Things are to be judged
              by their genuine tendencies.</li>
              <li class="consp">4. The light of reason, no more than revelation forces acquiescence.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">5.) With the additional advantage that every Christian, is bound to instruct
      and persuade others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>As containing truths not discoverable by natural reason.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> A mode of salvation for the ruined.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Duties unknown before.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Our relations to the Son and Holy Ghost.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Hence the form of baptism.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Pious regards to Christ, and the Holy Ghost, based on our relations to
      them.</li>
    </ul>

  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> The manner of external worship.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>The fearful hazard of neglecting Christianity.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Those who think natural religion <em>sufficient</em>, must admit that Christianity is
  highly <em>important</em>.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Our relations to Christ being made known, our religious regard to him is
  an evident obligation.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> These relations being real, there is no reason to think that our neglect of
  behaving suitably to them, will not be attended with the same kind of
  consequences as follow the neglect of duties made known by reason.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> If we are corrupt and depraved, and so unfit for heaven, and if we need
  God’s Holy Spirit to renew our nature, how can it be a slight thing
  whether we make use of the means for obtaining such assistance?</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Thus, if Christianity be either true, or merely credible, it is most rash and
  presumptuous to treat it lightly.</li>
</ul>

<h5>REMARKS.</h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> The distinction between positive and moral obligations.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) For moral precepts we can see <em>the reason</em>: for positive we cannot.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Moral duties are such <em>prior</em> to command; positive duties are such <em>because</em>

      <li class="consp">3.) The manner in which a duty is made known, does not make it moral or
      positive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The ground of regarding moral duties as superior to positive.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Both have the nature of moral commands.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) If the two conflict, we must obey the moral.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Positive institutions are <em>means</em> to moral ends.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Ends are more excellent than means.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Obedience to positive institutions, has no value but as proceeding from
          moral principle.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Both moral and positive duties are <em>revealed</em>, and so are on a level; but
      the moral law is <em>also</em> interwoven with our very nature, and so its
      precepts must prevail when the two interfere.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> There is less necessity for determining their relative authority, than some
  suppose.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Though man is disposed to outward and ritual religion, nothing can give
      us acceptance with God, without moral virtue.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Scripture always lays stress on moral duties.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) It is a great weakness, though very common, to make light of positive
      institutions, because less important than moral.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;We are bound to obey <em>all</em> God’s commands.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;A precept, merely positive, admitted to be from God, creates moral
          obligation, in the strictest sense.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

Christianity.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It is no presumption against Christianity, that it is not the discovery of
  reason, or of experience.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Nor is it a presumption against Christianity, that it contains things <em>unlike</em>
  the apparent course of nature.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) We cannot suppose every thing, in the vast universe, to be just like what
      is the course of nature in this little world.</li>

      greatly unlike.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> If we choose to call what is unlike our known course of things, <em>miraculous</em>,
  still that does not make it <em>improbable</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>There is no presumption against such a revelation, as we should

world.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> There was then <em>no</em> course of nature, as to this world.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Whether man <em>then</em> received a revelation involves a question not of miracles,
  but of <em>fact</em>.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Creation was a very different exertion of power from that which <em>rules</em> the
  world, now it <em>is</em> made.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Whether the power of forming <em>stopped</em> when man was made; or went on,
  and formed a religion for him, is merely a question as to the <em>degree</em> or
  <em>extent</em>, to which a power was exerted.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> There is then no presumption from analogy against supposing man had a
  revelation when created.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> All tradition and history teaches that he had, which amounts to a real and

</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>There is no presumption against miracles, or a miraculous revelation,

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Such a presumption, requires the adduction of some <em>parallel</em> case.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> This would require us to know the history of some other world.</li>

      <li class="consp">&mdash;Hence the question of a presumption against miracles, involves only
      the <em>degree</em> of presumption, (not whether the presumption is <em>peculiar</em>

  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> <em>Taking in religion</em>, there are distinct reasons for miracles; to afford

  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Miracles must not be compared with common events, but with uncommon;

<h4>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR INCAPACITY OF JUDGING WHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED IN A REVELATION
FROM GOD.</span></h4>

<p>Beside the objectors to the <em>evidences</em> of Christianity, there are many who
object to its <em>nature</em>. They say it is not full enough: has in it foolish things:
gives rise to superstition: subserves tyranny: is not universally known: not
well arranged: figurative language, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is granted that if it contained <em>immoralities</em> or <em>contradictions</em> they would
show it to be false. But other objections against religion, aside from objections
against its evidences, are frivolous: as will now be shown.</p>

<p>Let the student look to the <em>force</em> of the proofs, rather than any <em>consequences</em>
which may be drawn from them.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>The Scripture informs us of a scheme of government, in addition
to the material laws of the world.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> If both these schemes, the physical and the moral, coincide and form one
  whole, then our inability to criticise the system of nature, renders it
  credible that we are incompetent to criticise the system of grace.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Nature shows many things we should not have expected, prior to experience.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Hence it is altogether likely it would be so in religion.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> If a citizen is incompetent to judge of the propriety of the <em>general</em> laws of
  his government, he is equally incompetent to judge when and how far
  those laws should be suspended, or deviated from.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>We are no better judges of how revelation should be imparted.</i></h5>

<p>Whether to every man, or to some for others; or what mode
or degree of proof should be given; or whether the knowledge
should be given gradually or suddenly.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> We are not able to judge how much new knowledge ought to be given
  by revelation.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Nor how far, nor in what way, God should qualify men to transmit any
  revelation he might make.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Nor whether the evidence should be certain, probable, or doubtful.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Nor whether all should have the same benefit from it.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Nor whether it should be in writing, or verbal. If it be said that if not in
  writing it would not have answered its purpose: I ask, what purpose?
  Who knows what purposes would best suit God’s <em>general</em> government?</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> All which shows it to be absurd to object to particular things in revelation
  as unsuitable.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>Hence the only question, concerning the truth of revelation is,
whether it is a revelation.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> No obscurities, &amp;c. could overthrow the authority of a revelation.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> It can only be overthrown by nullifying the proofs.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Though the proofs could be shown to be less strong than is affirmed, it still
  should control our conduct.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">IV. <i>Modes of arguing, which are perfectly just, in relation to other
books, are not so as to the Bible.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> We are competent judges of common books, but not of Scripture.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Our only inquiry should be to find out the sense.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> In other books, internal improbabilities weaken external proof; but in
  regard to revelation, we scarcely know what are improbabilities.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Those who judge the Scripture by preconceived expectations, will imagine
      they find improbabilities.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) And so they would by thus judging in natural things.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;It would seem very improbable, prior to experience, that man should
          be better able to determine the magnitudes and motions of heavenly
          bodies, than he is to determine the causes and cures of disease, which
          much more nearly concerns him.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Or that we should sometimes hit upon a thing in an instant, even when
          thinking of something else, which we had been vainly trying to
          discover for years.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Or that language should be so liable to abuse, that every man may be
          a deceiver.</li>
          <li class="consp">&mdash;Or that brute instinct should ever be superior to reason.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">V. <i>Such observations apply to almost all objections to Christianity,
as distinguished from objections against its evidence.</i></h5>

<p>For instance, the disorderly manner in which some, in the apostolic age
used their miraculous gifts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> This does not prove the acts <em>not</em> miraculous.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The person having any such gift, would have the same power over it which
  he would have over any other ability, and might pervert it.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> To say why was he not also endued with prudence, to restrain its use,
  is but saying why did not God give a <em>higher degree</em> of miraculous
  endowment? As to which we are not competent judges.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> God does not confer his <em>natural</em> gifts, (memory, eloquence, knowledge, &amp;c.)
  only on those who are prudent and make the best use of them.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Nor is worldly instruction, by educators, commonly given in the happiest
  manner.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">VI. <i>There is a resemblance between religion and nature in several
other respects.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> In both, common and necessary things, are plain; but to “go on to perfection”
  in either, requires exact and laborious study.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The hinderances to both religious and physical knowledge, are the same
  in kind. A more perfect knowledge may be brought about,
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) By the progress of learning and liberty.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) By students attending to intimations overlooked by the generality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> It is not wonderful that our knowledge of Bible truth should be small; for
  the natural world has laid open to inspection, for thousands of years, and
  yet only lately are any great discoveries made.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Perhaps these scientific discoveries, are to be the means of opening and
  ascertaining Bible truth.</li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> The cases are not parallel; for natural knowledge is of no consequence,
  compared to spiritual.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. The cases <em>are</em> parallel; for natural knowledge is as important to
      our natural well-being, as spiritual knowledge is to our spiritual
      well-being.</li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 2. If the cases were not parallel, there are plenty of other analogies,
      which show that God does not dispense his gifts according to <em>our</em>
      notions of their value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 2. If Christianity be intended for the recovery of men, why not sooner
  introduced, and more widely diffused?
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> The objection is just as strong against the natural sciences. Nay, if the
      light of nature and of revelation are both from the same source, we
      might <em>expect</em> that revelation would have been introduced and diffused
      just as it is.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) Remedies for disease are known but to a few, or not known at all, nor to
          any without care and study.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) When proposed by discoverers, they have been treated with derision, and
          the use rejected by thousands whom they might have cured.</li>
          <li class="consp">3.) The best remedies have been used unskilfully, and so made to produce
          more disease.</li>
          <li class="consp">4.) Their benefit may come very slowly.</li>
          <li class="consp">5.) In some cases they may be wholly ineffectual.</li>
          <li class="consp">6.) They maybe so disagreeable that many will not submit to use them, even
          with the prospect of a cure.</li>
          <li class="consp">7.) Sometimes the remedy may be entirely out of reach if we were ready
          to take it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All this reasoning may be applied to Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h5 class="sub">VII. <i>Having obviated all objections to Christianity, from its containing
things we should not have expected, we will now
consider the objections against its morality.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Reason may judge, as to whether revelation contains things contrary to
  justice, and wisdom, &amp;c. as those attributes are taught by natural religion.
  But no such objections are advanced, except such as would equally
  condemn the constitution of nature.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> There are indeed particular precepts, to particular persons, which <em>would</em> be
  immoral, but for the precept. The precept changes the nature of the
  action.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> None are contrary to immutable morality. We are never commanded to
  cultivate the principles of ingratitude, treachery, &amp;c.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> God may command the taking of life or property because these are <em>his</em>.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> The only real difficulty is, that such commands are liable to be perverted by
  the wicked to their own horrid purposes; and to mislead the weak. But
  such objections do not lie against revelation, as such, but against the very
  notion of <em>religion as a trial</em>.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> The sum of the whole is, objections against the <em>scheme</em> of Christianity
  do not affect its truth; since there are no objections against its morality.
  Hence objections against it, aside from its evidences, are frivolous. Objections
  against the <em>evidence</em>, will be considered in a subsequent chapter,
  [<i>i.e.</i> ch. vii.]</li>
</ul>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">CHRISTIANITY A SCHEME IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD.</span></h4>

<p>In the last chapter it was shown that we might expect, beforehand, that a
revelation would contain strange things, and things liable to great objections.</p>

<p>This abates the force of such objections, or rather precludes them.</p>

<p>But it may be said this does not show such objectionable things to be good,
or credible.</p>

<p>It was a sufficient answer [ch. vii. part i.] to objections against the course
of nature, that it was a <em>scheme</em>, imperfectly comprehended.</p>

<p>If Christianity be a scheme, the like objections admit of a like answer.</p>

<p>[In studying this chapter, let <a href="#I_CHAPTER_VII">chap. vii. part i.</a> be kept in view.]</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>Christianity is a scheme, beyond our comprehension.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> God’s <em>general</em> plan is to conduct things <em>gradually</em>, so that, finally, every one
  shall receive what he deserves.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Christianity is a <em>particular</em> arrangement, under this general plan: is a part
  of it, and conduces to its completion.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> It is itself a complicated and mysterious economy.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Its arrangements began from the fall of man.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Various dispensations, patriarchal, prophetic, &amp;c. were preparatory to it.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) At a certain juncture in the condition of the world Jesus Christ came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></li>
      <li class="consp">4.) The mission of the Holy Ghost was part of this economy.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) Christ now presides over it, and will establish the church, judge the
      world, give up the kingdom, &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Of course, we can comprehend but little of such a scheme.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> We plainly see, from what is revealed, that there is very much unrevealed.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> Thus it is evident that we are as little capable of judging as to the whole
  system of religion, as we are as to the whole system of nature.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>In both material and spiritual things, means are used to
accomplish ends.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Hence a thing may seem foolish to us, because we do not know its object
  and end.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Its seeming foolish to us, is no proof that it is so.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>Christianity is carried on by general laws, no less than nature.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Why do we say there are <em>laws of nature</em>?
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) We indeed know some such. But nothing of the laws of many things, <i>e.g.</i>
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">· Pestilence.</li>
          <li class="consp">· Storms.</li>
          <li class="consp">· Earthquakes.</li>
          <li class="consp">· Diversities of human powers.</li>
          <li class="consp">· Association of ideas.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Hence we call many things <em>accidental</em>, which we know are not matters
      of chance, but are subject to general laws.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) It is a very little way that we can trace things to their general laws.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) We attribute many things to such laws, only by analogy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Just for the same reasons, we say that miracles comport with God’s <em>general
  laws of wisdom</em>. These laws may be unknown to us; but no more so than
  those by which some die as soon as born, or live to old age, or have
  superior understandings, &amp;c.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> We see no more reason to regard the frame and course of nature as a
  scheme, than we have to regard Christianity as such.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) If the first is a scheme, then Christianity, if true, would be <em>likely</em> to be
      a scheme.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) As Christianity is revealed but in part, and is an arrangement to
      accomplish ends, there would of course seem to us, in it, irregularities;
      just as we see in nature.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Therefore objections against the one, are answered in the same manner
      as objections against the other.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having, in a previous chapter, [<a href="#II_CHAPTER_III">ch. iii.</a>,] answered objections to Christianity
<em>as a matter of fact</em>, and in this, as a general question of <em>wisdom and goodness</em>,
the next thing is to discuss <em>objections in particular</em>.</p>

<p>As one of these is directed against <em>the scheme</em>, as just now described, it will
be considered here.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> Christianity is a roundabout, and perplexed contrivance; just such as
  men, for want of understanding or power, are obliged to adopt, in
  their designs.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1.) God uses just such complex arrangements in the natural world. The
      mystery is quite as great in nature as in grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></li>
      <li class="consp">2.) We do not know what are means, and what are ends.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) The natural world, and its government, are not fixed, but progressive.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Great length of time is required in some changes; <i>e.g.</i> animals, vegetables,
      geological periods, &amp;c.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) One state of life is a preparation and means for attaining another.</li>
      <li class="consp">6.) Man is impatient, but Jehovah deliberate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">OF A MEDIATOR, AND REDEMPTION BY HIM.</span></h4>

<p>Nothing in Christianity is so much objected to as the position assigned to
Christ; yet nothing is more unjust. The whole world exhibits mediation.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>Our existence, and all its satisfactions, are by the medium of others.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> If so in the natural world, why not in the spiritual?</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The objection therefore is not only against <em>Christ’s</em> mediation, but <em>all</em>
  mediation.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>We cannot know all the ends for which God punishes, nor by
whom he should punish.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Future punishment may be as natural a sequence of sin, as a broken limb
  is of falling from a precipice.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> This is not taking punishment out of the hands of God, and giving it to
  nature; it is only distinguishing ordinary events from miraculous.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>In natural providence, God has made provision that the bad
consequences of actions do not always follow.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> We may say God could have prevented all evil. But we see he permits it,
  and has provided relief, and even sometimes perfect remedies for it.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Thus the bad consequences of trifling on a precipice may be prevented
      by a friend, if we do not reject his assistance.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) We may ourselves do much towards preventing the bad consequences of
      our misdeeds.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Still more if assisted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> It might have been perfectly just if it were not so; but that it is so, shows
  compassion, as distinguished from goodness.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> The course of nature affords many instances of such compassion.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Thus analogy sanctions an arrangement, by which the ruinous consequences
  of vice or folly may be averted, at least in some cases.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> If the consequences of rash and inconsiderate acts, which we scarcely call
  vicious, are often so serious, we may apprehend that the bad consequences
  will be greater, in proportion as the irregularity is greater.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> A dissolute disregard to all religion, if there be a religion, is incomparably
  more reprehensible than the mere neglects, imprudencies, &amp;c. of this life.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>7.</b> As the effects of worldly imprudence and vice are often misery, ruin, and
  even death, no one can say what may be the consequences of blasphemy,
  contempt of God, and final impenitence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></li>
  <li class="consp"><b>8.</b> Nor can any one tell, how far the consequences of such great wickedness
  can possibly be prevented, consistently with the eternal rule of right.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>9.</b> Still there would, from analogy, be some hope of room for pardon.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">IV. <i>There is no probability that any thing we could do alone, would
entirely prevent the effects of our irregularities.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> We do not know all the reasons for punishment, nor why it should be fit
  to remit punishment.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Nor do we know all the consequences of vice, and so should not know how
  to prevent them.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Vice impairs men’s abilities for helping themselves.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Misconduct makes assistance necessary, which otherwise would not have
  been. Why should not the same things be so, as to our future interests?</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> In temporal things, behaving well in time to come, does not repair old errors,
  why should it as to future things?</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> Were it so in <em>all cases</em> it would be contrary to all our notions of government.</li>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUPPOSED LACK OF PROOF OF REVELATION, AND ITS WANT OF UNIVERSALITY.</span></h4>

<p>It has been thought to be a positive argument against revelation, that its
evidences are not adequate, and that it is not universally known and believed.</p>

<p>But the argument amounts to just this, that God would not bestow on us any
favor, except in such a mode and degree as we thought best, and did exactly
the same for everybody else.</p>

<p>Such a notion, all analogy contradicts.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>Men act in their most important concerns on doubtful evidence.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It is often absolutely <em>impossible</em> to say which of two modes of acting will
  give most pleasure or profit.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> If it were possible, we cannot know what changes temper, satiety, ill
  health, &amp;c. might produce, so as to destroy our pleasure.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> We cannot foresee what accidents may cut it all off.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Strong objections and difficulties may attach to the course of action we
  adopt, which yet all would admit ought not to deter us.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> We may, after all, be deceived by appearances, or by our passions, &amp;c.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> Men think it reasonable to engage in pursuit of advantage, even when the
  probabilities of success are against them.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>As to the light of Christianity not being universal.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Temporal good is enjoyed in very different degrees even among creatures
  of the same species.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Yet it is certain that God governs.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> We may prudently or imprudently use our good things.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> The Jewish religion was not universal.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> If it be <em>intended</em> that Christianity should be a small light, shining in a
  great and wide-spread darkness, it would be perfectly uniform with
  other parts of God’s providence.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> If some have Christianity so corrupted, and interpolated, as to cause
  thoughtful persons to doubt it, as is the case in some countries; and if,
  where it is the purest, some learn much less from it than they might, there
  are manifest parallels in God’s natural dispensations.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>7.</b> No more is expected of any one, than is equitable under his circumstances.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>8.</b> Every one is bound to get rid of his ignorance, as far as he can, and to
  instruct his neighbor.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>9.</b> If revelation <em>were</em> universal, in extent and degree, different understandings,
  educations, tempers, length of lives, and outward advantages, would soon
  make the knowledge of it as different as it is at present.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>Practical reflections.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><i>First.</i> That the evidence of religion is not such as unavoidably to convince all,
  may be part of our probation.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It gives scope for a wise or vicious use of our understanding. Just as is
      the case in common affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></li>
      <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Intellectual inattention to so serious a matter, is as immoral, as disobedience
      after conviction of the truth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Secondly.</i> If the evidence is really doubtful, it puts us on probation.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> If a man were in doubt whether a certain person had done him the greatest
      favor, or whether his whole temporal interest depended on him, he ought
      not to regard that person as he would if there were <em>no</em> reason to think so.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> So if there is only reason to apprehend that Christianity <em>may</em> be true, we
      are as much bound to <em>examine</em>, &amp;c. as we would be bound to <em>obey</em>, if we
      <em>knew</em> it was true.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Considering the infinite importance of religion, there is not much difference
      as to what ought to be the mode of life of those who are convinced
      and those who doubt its truth. Their hopes and fears are the same in
      kind, though not in degree; and so their obligations are much the same.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Doubts presuppose <em>some</em> evidence, belief <em>more</em>, and certainty <em>more still</em>.
      Each state should influence our conduct, and does so, in common things.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> It shows a mental defect not to see evidence unless it is glaring; and a
      corrupt heart not to be influenced by it unless overpowering.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Thirdly.</i> Difficulties as to believing religion, are no more a ground of complaint,
  than difficulties in practising it.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> They constitute a wholesome discipline.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp">1.) In allowing an unfair mind to deceive itself.</li>
          <li class="consp">2.) In requiring belief and the practice of virtue under some uncertainties.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> In the case of some minds, speculative difficulties as to the evidence of
      religion is the <em>principal</em> trial. A full conviction of its truth would
      <em>constrain</em> some to obedience.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Fourthly.</i> The difficulties may be <em>in the objector</em> rather than in the religion.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Not sufficiently in earnest to be informed.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Secretly <em>wishes</em> religion not to be true.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Looks at objections rather than replies.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Treats the subject ludicrously.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><i>Fifthly.</i> The proof of Christianity is level to common men.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> They are capable of being convinced of the existence of God, and of their
      moral accountability.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> And they can understand the evidence of miracles, and the fulfilment of
      prophecy.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> If they are capable of seeing the difficulty, they are capable of understanding
      the proof.</li>
      <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> If they pick up objections from hearsay, and will not or cannot examine
      them thoroughly, they must remain ignorant, just as they do as to the
      sciences.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> Our directions should be too plain to <em>admit</em> of doubt; like those of an
          earthly master.
            <ul>
              <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> The earthly master only wants his work done, and is careless as to the
              state of the heart; but as the whole of morality consists in the state of
              the heart, the cases are not parallel.</li>
           </ul>
         </li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="consp"><i>Finally.</i> The credibility of our being in a state of probation is just as great
    as the credibility of there being any religion. Our probation may
    be whether we choose to inform ourselves as to our duty, and then
    whether we choose to do it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span><br />
    <span class="sub-line">Such is exactly the case as to temporal matters. To discern what is
    best often requires difficult consideration, and yet leaves doubts:
    and not reflecting carefully, or not acting even when there may
    be doubt, is often fatal.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">POSITIVE EVIDENCES OF CHRISTIANITY.</span></h4>

<p>Having considered the objections both to the general scheme of Christianity,
and to particular doctrines in it, it only remains to consider the positive evidence
of its truth; <i>i.e.</i> what analogy teaches with regard to that evidence.</p>

<p>There are many evidences of Christianity, beside those from miracles or
prophecy, which are the principal; embracing a great variety of proofs, direct
and collateral, and reaching through all past time. We shall now consider
the proofs from <span class="smcapuc">MIRACLES</span> and <span class="smcapuc">PROPHECY</span>.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>Miracles.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Bible history gives the same evidence for the miracles described, as for
  common events.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) The miracles are evidently not put in for ornament, as speeches are by
      historians and poets put into the mouths of heroes.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) The accounts of them have been quoted as genuine, by various writers,
      from that day to this.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) These accounts are confirmed by subsequent events; and the miracles
      alone, can account for those events.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) The only fair way of accounting for these statements, and their reception
      in the world, is that the things really happened.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) The statements should be admitted till disproved, even if doubtful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Paul’s Epistles have evidences of genuineness, beyond what can attach to
  mere history.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) <i>Additional.</i> His evidence is quite detached. He received the gospel not
      in common with the other apostles, but separately, and direct from
      Christ, <em>after</em> his ascension.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) <i>Peculiar.</i> He speaks of Christ’s miracles and those of others <em>incidentally</em>,
      as familiar facts, fully believed by those to whom he wrote.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Christianity demands credence on the ground of its miracles, and was so
  received by great numbers, at the time and on the spot; which is the
  case with no other religion.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Its first converts embraced it on this ground.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) It is not conceivable that they would have done so, at such fearful
      sacrifice, unless fully satisfied of the truth of these miracles.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Such a profession and sacrifices furnish the same kind of evidence as
      if they had testified to the truth of the miracles in writing.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) It is real evidence, for they had full opportunity to inform themselves.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) It is a sort of evidence <em>distinct</em> from direct history, though of the same
      nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></li>
      <li class="consp">6.) Men are suspicious as well as credulous, and slow to believe <em>against their
      interests</em>, as these did.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> It lies upon unbelievers to show why all this array of proof is to be
  rejected; but in such an important concern we shall proceed to notice
  some possible objections.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 1. Enthusiasts make similar sacrifices for idle follies.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. This objection ignores the distinction between opinions and facts.
          Suffering for an opinion is no proof of its truth; but in attestation
          of observed facts, it is proof.</li>
          <li class="consp">2. Enthusiasm <em>weakens</em> testimony, it is true, even as to facts; and so does
          disease, <em>in particular instances</em>. But when great numbers, not weak,
          nor negligent, affirm that <em>they</em> saw and heard certain things, it is the
          fullest evidence.</li>
          <li class="consp">3. To reject testimony on the ground of enthusiasm, requires that the
          things testified be <em>incredible</em>; which has not been shown, as to
          religion, but the contrary.</li>
          <li class="consp">4. Religion is not the only thing in regard to which witnesses are liable
          to enthusiasm. In common matters, we <em>get at the truth</em> through
          witnesses, though influenced by party spirit, custom, humor,
          romance, &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 2. Enthusiasm and knavery may have been combined in the apostles
      and first Christians.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> Such a mixture is often seen, and is often reproved in Scripture; but not
          more in religious than in common affairs. Men in all matters deceive
          themselves and others, in every degree, yet human testimony is good
          ground of belief.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 3. Men have been deluded by false miracles.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> Not oftener than by other pretences.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="consp"><i>Objec.</i> 4. Fabulous miracles have historical evidence.
        <ul>
          <li class="consp"><i>Ans.</i> 1. If this were equal to that for Scripture miracles, the evidence for the
          latter would not be <em>impaired</em>. The objection really amounts to this,
          that evidence proved not to be good, destroys evidence which is good
          and unconfuted! Or to this, that if two men, of equal reputation,
          testify, in <em>cases not related</em> to each other, and one is proved false, the
          other must not be believed!</li>
          <li class="consp">2. Nothing can rebut testimony, but proof that the witness is incompetent,
          or misled.</li>
          <li class="consp">3. Against all such objections must be set the fact that Christianity was
          too serious a matter to allow the first converts to be careless as to its
          evidence; and also that their religion forbid them to deceive others.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>As to the evidence from prophecy.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Obscurity as to <em>part</em> of a prophecy does not invalidate it, but is, as to us, as
  if that part were not written, or were lost. We may not see the whole
  prophecy fulfilled, and yet see enough fulfilled to perceive in it more
  than human foresight.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> A <em>long series</em> of prophecies, all applicable to certain events, is proof that
  such events were intended. This answers the objection that <em>particular</em>
  prophecies were not intended to be applied as Christians apply them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><br />
  <span class="sub-line">Mythological and satirical writings greatly resemble prophecy. Now we
  apply a parable, or fable, or satire, merely from seeing it <em>capable</em> of such
  application.</span><br />
  <span class="sub-line">So if a long series of prophecies be <em>applicable</em> to the present state of the
  world, or to the coming of Christ, it is proof that they were so <em>intended</em>.</span><br />
  <span class="sub-line">Besides, the ancient Jews, <em>before</em> Christ, applied the prophecies to him, just
  as Christians do now.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> If it could be shown that the prophets did not understand their own predictions,
  or that their prophecies are capable of being applied to other
  events than those to which Christians apply them, it would not abate the
  force of the argument from prophecy, even with regard to those instances.
  For,
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) To know the whole meaning of an author we must know the whole
      meaning of his book, but knowing the meaning of a book is not
      knowing the whole mind of the author.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) If the book is a <em>compilation</em>, the authors may have meanings deeper
      than the compiler saw. If the prophets spoke by inspiration, they are
      not the authors, but the writers of prophecy, and may not have known
      all that the Divine Spirit intended. But the fulfilment of the prophecy
      shows a foresight more than human.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>REMARK.</h5>

<p>This whole argument is just and real; but it is not expected that those will
be satisfied who will not submit to the perplexity and labor of understanding
it; or who have not modesty and fairness enough to allow an argument its due
weight; or who wilfully discard the whole investigation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4 class="hidden">THE GENERAL ARGUMENT</h4>

<p>We <em>now</em> proceed to <span class="smcapuc">THE GENERAL ARGUMENT</span> embracing both direct and circumstantial
evidence. A full discussion would require a volume, and cannot
be expected here; but <em>something</em> should be said, especially as most questions
of difficulty, in practical affairs, are settled by evidence arising from circumstances
which confirm each other.</p>

<p>The thing asserted is that God has given us a revelation declaring himself
to be a moral governor; stating his system of government; and disclosing a
plan for the recovery of mankind out of sin, and raising them to perfect and
final happiness.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>Consider this revelation as a history.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> It furnishes an account of the world, as God’s world.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) God’s providence, commands, promises, and threatenings.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) Distinguishes God from idols.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) Describes the condition of religion and of its professors, in a world
      considered as apostate and wicked.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Political events are related as affecting religion, and not for their
      importance as mere political events.</li>
      <li class="consp">5.) The history is continued by prophecy, to the end of the world.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> It embraces a vast variety of other topics; natural and moral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
    <ul>

      <li class="consp">2.) So that <em>doubts</em> of its truth confirm that truth, for in this enlightened age
      the claims of a book of such a nature could be easily and finally shown
      to be false, if they were so.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) None who believe in natural religion, hold that Christianity has been
      thus confuted.</li>

</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>As to the authenticity of this history.</i></h5>

<p>Suppose a person ignorant of all history but the Bible, and not knowing
even that to be true, were to inquire into its evidence of authenticity, he
would find,</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> That natural religion owes its establishment to <em>the truths</em> contained in this
  book. This no more <em>disproves</em> natural religion, than our learning a
  proposition from Euclid, shows that the proposition was not true before
  Euclid.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> The great antiquity of revelation.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> That its chronology is not contradicted but confirmed by known facts.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> That there is nothing in the history itself to awaken suspicion of its
  fidelity.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) Every thing said to be done in any age or country, is conformable to the
      manners of that age and country.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) The characters are all perfectly natural.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) All the domestic and political incidents are credible. Some of these,
      taken alone, seem strange to <em>some</em>, in <em>this</em> day; but not more so than
      things now occurring.</li>
      <li class="consp">4.) Transcribers may have made errors, but these are not more numerous
      than in other ancient books; and none of them impair the narrative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> That profane authors confirm Scripture accounts.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> That the credibility of the <em>general</em> history, confirms the accounts of the
  miracles, for they are all interwoven, and make but one statement.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>7.</b> That there certainly was and is such a people as the Jews; whose form of
  government was founded on these very books of Moses; and whose
  acknowledgment of the God of the Bible, kept them a distinct race.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>8.</b> That one Jesus, of Jewish extraction, arose at the time when the Jews
  expected a Messiah, was rejected by them, as was prophesied, and was
  received by the Gentiles, as was prophesied.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>9.</b> That the religion of this Jesus spread till it became the religion of the
  world, notwithstanding every sort of resistance; and has continued till
  now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></li>
  <li class="consp"><b>10.</b> That the Jewish government was destroyed, and the people dispersed into
  all lands; and still for many centuries, continue to be a distinct race,
  professing the law of Moses. If this separateness be <em>accounted for</em>, in
  any way, it does not destroy the fact that it was <em>predicted</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>CONCLUSION.</h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Recapitulation of the preceding ten observations.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Add the fact that there are obvious appearances in the world, aside from
  the Jews, which correspond to prophetic history.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> These appearances, compared with Bible history, and with each other, in
  <em>a joint view</em>, will appear to be of great weight, and would impress one
  who regarded them for the first time, more than they do us who have
  been familiar with them.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> The preceding discussion, though not thorough, amounts to proof of something
  more than human in this matter.
    <ul>
      <li class="consp">1.) The sufficiency of these proofs may be denied, but the <em>existence</em> of them
      cannot be.</li>
      <li class="consp">2.) The conformity of prophecies to events may be said to be accidental, but
      the <em>conformity itself</em> cannot be denied.</li>
      <li class="consp">3.) These collateral proofs may be pronounced fanciful, but it cannot be said
      they are <em>nothing</em>. Probabilities may not amount to demonstration, but
      they remain probabilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Those who will set down all seeming completions of prophecy, and judge
  of them by the common rules of evidence, will find that <em>together</em> they
  amount to strong proof. Because probable proofs, added together, not
  only increase evidence, but multiply it.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>6.</b> It is very well to observe objections; but it should be remembered that a
  mistake on one side is far more dangerous than a mistake on the other;
  and the safest conclusion is the best.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>7.</b> Religion, like other things, is to be judged by all the evidence taken
  together. Unless <em>all</em> its proofs be overthrown, it remains proved. If
  no proof singly were sufficient, the whole taken together might be.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>8.</b> It is much easier to start an objection, than to comprehend the united force
  of a whole argument.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>9.</b> Thus it appears that the positive evidence of revelation cannot be destroyed,
 though it should be lessened.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE ANALOGICAL ARGUMENT.</span></h4>

<p>If all made up their minds with proper care and candor, there would be no
need of this chapter. But some do not try to understand what they condemn;
and our mode of argument is open to objections, especially in the minds of
those who judge without thinking. The chief objections will therefore be considered.
They are these:&mdash;it does not solve difficulties in revelation to say
that there are as great in natural religion:&mdash;it will not make men religious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
show them that it is <em>as</em> important as worldly prudence, for showing that, does
not make them prudent:&mdash;the justice of God in the system of religion, is not
proved by showing it is as apparent as in his natural providence:&mdash;no reasoning
from analogy can carry full conviction:&mdash;mankind will not renounce present
pleasures, for a religion which is not free from doubt. To each of which
a reply will now be given.</p>

<h5 class="sub">I. <i>As to requiring a solution of all difficulties.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> This is but resolving to comprehend the nature of God, and the whole plan
  of his government throughout eternity.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> It is always right to argue from what is known, to what is disputed. We
  are constantly so doing. The most eminent physician does not understand
  all diseases, yet we do not despise what he does know.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> It is very important to find that objections against revelation are just as
  strong, not only against natural religion, but against the course of nature.</li>

</ul>

<h5 class="sub">II. <i>As to men’s having as little reason for worldly pursuits, as they
have for being religious.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> If men can be convinced that they have as much reason to be religious as
  they have to practise worldly prudence, then <em>there is</em> a reason for being
  religious.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> If religion proposes greater than worldly interests, and has the same reasons
  for belief, then it has proportionally a greater claim.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> If religion being left doubtful, proves it to be false, then doubts as to the
  success of any worldly pursuit show it to be wrong. Yet we constantly
  act, even in the most important affairs, without <em>certainty</em> of being right.</li>

</ul>

<h5 class="sub">III. <i>As to the justice and goodness of God in religion.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> Our business is not to vindicate God, but to learn our duty, governed as we
  are; which is a very different thing. It has been shown that if we knew
  all things, present, past, and future, and the relations of each thing to all
  other things, we might see to be just and good what now do not seem so:
  and it is probable we should.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> We do not say that objections against God’s justice and goodness are
  removed by showing the like objections against natural providence, but
  that they are not <em>conclusive</em>, because they apply equally to what we know
  to be facts.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> The existence of objections does not destroy the evidence of facts. The
  fact for instance that God rewards and punishes, though men may think
  it unjust. Even necessity, plead for human acts, does no more to abolish
  justice than it does injustice.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> Though the reasonableness of Christianity cannot be shown from analogy,
  the truth of it may. The truth of a fact may be proved without regard
  to its quality. The reasonableness of obeying Christianity is proved,
  if we barely prove Christianity itself to be possible.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>5.</b> Though analogy may not show Christian precepts to be good, it proves
  them to be credible.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h5 class="sub">IV. <i>The analogical argument does not remove doubt.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> What opinion does any man hold, about which there can be no doubt?
  Even the best way of preserving and enjoying this life, is not agreed
  upon. Whether our measures will accomplish our objects, is always
  uncertain; and still more whether the objects, if accomplished, will
  give us happiness. Yet men do not on this account refuse to make
  exertion.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> This objection overlooks the very nature of religion. The embracing of it
  presupposes a certain degree of candor and integrity, to try which, and
  exercise, and improve it, is its intention. Just as warning a man of
  danger, presupposes a disposition to avoid danger.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Religion is a probation, and has evidence enough as such; and would not
  be such, if it compelled assent.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>4.</b> We never mean by sufficient evidence, such an amount as necessarily
  determines a man to act, but only such as will show an action to be
  prudent.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sub">V. <i>As to the small influence of the analogical argument.</i></h5>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> As just observed, religion is a <em>test</em>, and an <em>exercise</em>, of character; and that
  some reject it is nothing to our purpose. We are inquiring not what sort
  of creature man is, but what he should be. This is each man’s own
  concern.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Religion, as a probation, accomplishes its end, whether individuals believe
  or not.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Even this objection admits that religion has some weight, and of course
  it should have some influence; and if so, there is the same reason,
  though not so strong, for publishing it, that there would be, if it were
  likely to have greater influence.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Further.</span> It must be considered that the reasoning in this treatise is on the
principles of other men, and arguments of the utmost importance are omitted,
because not universally admitted. Thus as to Fatalism, and the abstract fitness
or unfitness of actions. The general argument is just a question of fact, and
is here so treated. Abstract truths are usually advanced as proof; but in this
work, only <em>facts</em> are adduced. That the three angles of a triangle are equal to
two right angles, is an abstract truth: but that they so appear to us, is only
a matter of fact. That there is such a thing as abstract right and wrong, which
determines the will of God in rewarding and punishing, is an assertion of an
abstract truth, as well as a fact. Suppose God in this world rewarded and
punished every man exactly as he obeyed or disobeyed his conscience, this
would not be an abstract truth, but a fact. And if all acknowledged this as a
fact, all would not see it to be right. If, instead of his doing it now, we say
he will do it hereafter, this too is not an abstract truth, but a question of fact.
This fact could be fully proved on the abstract principles of moral fitness; but
without them, there has now been given a <em>conclusive practical proof</em>; which
though it may be cavilled at, and shown not to amount to demonstration, cannot
be answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence it may be said as to the force of this treatise,</p>

<ul>
  <li class="consp"><b>1.</b> To such as are convinced of the truth of revelation, as proved on the
  principles of liberty and moral fitness, it will furnish a full confirmation.
  To such as do not admit those principles it is an original proof.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>2.</b> Those who believe will find objections removed, and those who disbelieve
  will find they have no grounds for their scepticism; and a good deal
  beside.</li>
  <li class="consp"><b>3.</b> Thus though some may think <em>too much</em> is here made of analogy, yet there
  can be no denying that the argument is <em>real</em>. It confirms <em>all facts</em> to
  which it can be applied; and of many is the only proof. It is strong
  on the side of religion, and ought to be regarded by such as prefer facts
  to abstract reasonings.</li>
</ul>

<h5>CONCLUSION.</h5>

<p>Recapitulates the general structure and design of the argument, the classes
of persons for whose benefit it is particularly adopted, and declares those who
reject Christianity to be wholly without excuse.</p>

<p>If the reader should here meet with any thing which he had not
before attended to, it will not be in the observations upon the constitution
and course of nature, these being all obvious, but in the application
of them; in which, though there is nothing but what appears
to me of some real weight, and therefore of great importance, yet he
will observe several things, which will appear to him of very little,
if he can think things to be of little importance, which are of any
real weight at all, upon such a subject of religion. However, the
proper force of the following treatise lies in the whole general analogy
considered together.</p>

<p>It is come, I know not how to be taken for granted, by many
persons, that Christianity is not so much as a subject of inquiry;
but that it is, now at length, discovered to be fictitious. Accordingly
they treat it, as if, in the present age, this were an agreed point
among all people of discernment; and nothing remained, but to set
it up as a principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were by way
of reprisals, for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the
world. On the contrary, thus much at least, will be here found, not
taken for granted but proved, that any reasonable man, who will
thoroughly consider the matter, may be as much assured, as he is
of his own being, that it is not so clear a case, that there is nothing
in it. There is, I think, strong evidence of its truth; but it is certain
no one can, upon principles of reason, be satisfied of the contrary.
The practical consequence to be drawn from this, is not attended to
by every one who is concerned in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Probable evidence is essentially distinguished from demonstrative
by this, that it admits of degrees; and of all variety of
them, from the highest moral certainty, to the very lowest presumption.
We cannot indeed say a thing is probably true upon
one very slight presumption for it; because, as there may be probabilities
on both sides of a question, there may be some against
it; and though there be not, yet a slight presumption does not
beget that degree of conviction, which is implied in saying a
thing is probably true. But that the slightest possible presumption
is of the nature of a probability, appears from hence; that
such low presumption, often repeated, will amount even to moral
certainty. Thus a man’s having observed the ebb and flow of
the tide to-day, affords some sort of presumption, though the
lowest imaginable, that it may happen again to-morrow: but the
observation of this event for so many days, and months, and ages
together, as it has been observed by mankind, gives us a full
assurance that it will.</p>

<p>That which chiefly constitutes <em>probability</em> is expressed in the
word <em>likely</em>, <i>i.e.</i> like some truth,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or true event; like it, in itself,
in its evidence, in some (more or fewer) of its circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> For
when we determine a thing to be probably true, suppose that an
event has or will come to pass, it is from the mind’s remarking
in it a likeness to some other event, which we have observed has
come to pass. This observation forms, in numberless daily instances,
a presumption, opinion, or full conviction, that such
event has or will come to pass; according as the observation is,
that the like event has sometimes, most commonly, or always, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
far as our observation reaches, come to pass at like distances of
time, or place, or upon like occasions. Hence arises the belief,
that a child, if it lives twenty years, will grow up to the stature
and strength of a man; that food will contribute to the preservation
of its life, and the want of it for such a number of days, be
its certain destruction. So likewise the rule and measure of our
hopes and fears concerning the success of our pursuits; our expectations
that others will act so and so in such circumstances;
and our judgment that such actions proceed from such principles;
all these rely upon our having observed the like to what we hope,
fear, expect, judge; I say, upon our having observed the like,
either with respect to others or ourselves. Thus, the prince<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
who had always lived in a warm climate, naturally concluded in
the way of analogy, that there was no such thing as water’s becoming
hard, because he had always observed it to be fluid and
yielding. We, on the contrary, from analogy conclude, that there
is no presumption at all against this: that it is supposable there
may be frost in England any given day in January next; probable
that there will on some day of the month; and that there
is a moral certainty, <i>i.e.</i> ground for an expectation without any
doubt of it, in some part or other of the winter.</p>

<p>Probable evidence, in its very nature, affords but an imperfect
kind of information; and is to be considered as relative only to
beings of limited capacities. For nothing which is the possible
object of knowledge, whether past, present, or future, can be probable
to an infinite intelligence; since it cannot but be discerned
absolutely as it is in itself, certainly true, or certainly false. But
to us, probability is the very guide of life.</p>

<p>From these things it follows, that in questions of difficulty, or
such as are thought so, where more satisfactory evidence cannot
be had, or is not seen; if the result of examination be, that there
appears upon the whole, any even the lowest presumption on one
side, and none on the other, or a greater presumption on one side,
though in the lowest degree greater; this determines the question,
even in matters of speculation. In matters of practice, it
will lay us under an absolute and formal obligation, in point of
prudence and of interest, to act upon that presumption or low
probability, though it be so low as to leave the mind in very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
doubt which is the truth. For surely a man is as really bound
in prudence to do what upon the whole, according to the best of
his judgment, appears to be for his happiness,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as what he certainly
knows to be so.</p>

<p>Further, in questions of great consequence, a reasonable man
will think it concerns him to remark lower probabilities and presumptions
than these; such as amount to no more than showing
one side of a question to be as supposable and credible as the
other: nay, such even as but amount to much less than this.
For numberless instances might be mentioned respecting the common
pursuits of life, where a man would be thought, in a literal
sense, distracted, who would not act, and with great application
too, not only upon an even chance, but upon much less, and
where the probability or chance was greatly against his succeeding.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It is not my design to inquire further into the nature, the
foundation, and measure of probability; or whence it proceeds
that <em>likeness</em> should beget that presumption, opinion, and full
conviction, which the human mind is formed to receive from it,
and which it does necessarily produce in every one; or to guard
against the errors, to which reasoning from analogy is liable.
This belongs to the subject of Logic; and is a part of that subject
which has not yet been thoroughly considered. Indeed I
shall not take upon me to say, how far the extent, compass, and
force, of analogical reasoning, can be reduced to general heads
and rules; and the whole be formed into a system. But though
so little in this way has been attempted by those who have treated
of our intellectual powers, and the exercise of them; this does
not hinder but that we may be, as we unquestionably are, assured,
that analogy is of weight, in various degrees, towards determining
our judgment and our practice. Nor does it in any wise
cease to be of weight in those cases, because persons, either given
to dispute, or who require things to be stated with greater exactness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
than our faculties appear to admit of in practical matters,
may find other cases in which it is not easy to say, whether it be,
or be not, of any weight; or instances of seeming analogies,
which are really of none. It is enough to the present purpose to
observe, that this general way of arguing is evidently natural,
just, and conclusive. For there is no man can make a question
but that the sun will rise to-morrow, and be seen, where it is seen
at all, in the figure of a circle, and not in that of a square.</p>

<p>Hence, namely from analogical reasoning, Origen<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has with
singular sagacity observed, that “<cite>he who believes the Scripture
to have proceeded from him who is the Author of nature, may
well expect to find the same sort of difficulties in it, as are found
in the constitution of nature</cite>.” And in a like way of reflection
it may be added, that he who denies the Scripture to have been
from God upon account of these difficulties, may, for the very
same reason, deny the world to have been formed by him. On
the other hand, if there be an analogy or likeness between that
system of things and dispensation of Providence, which <em>revelation</em>
informs us of, and that system of things and dispensation of
Providence, which <em>experience</em> together with reason informs us
of, <i>i.e.</i> the known course of nature; this is a presumption, that
they have both the same author and cause; at least so far as to
answer objections against the former’s being from God, drawn
from any thing which is analogical or similar to what is in the
latter, which is acknowledged to be from him; for an Author of
nature is here supposed.</p>

<p>Forming our notions of the constitution and government of
the world upon reasoning, without foundation for the principles
which we assume, whether from the attributes of God, or any
thing else, is building a world upon hypothesis, like Des Cartes.
Forming our notions upon reasoning from principles which are
certain, but applied to cases to which we have no ground to
apply them, (like those who explain the structure of the human
body, and the nature of diseases and medicines, from mere mathematics,)
is an error much akin to the former: since what is assumed
in order to make the reasoning applicable, is Hypothesis.
But it must be allowed just, to join abstract reasonings with the
observation of facts, and argue from such facts as are known, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
others that are like them; from that part of the divine government
over intelligent creatures which comes under our view, to
that larger and more general government over them which is
beyond it; and from what is present, to collect what is likely,
credible, or not incredible, will be hereafter.</p>

<p>This method then of concluding and determining being practical,
and what, if we will act at all, we cannot but act upon in the
common pursuits of life; being evidently conclusive, in various
degrees, proportionable to the degree and exactness of the whole
analogy or likeness; and having so great authority for its introduction
into the subject of religion, even revealed religion; my
design is to apply it to that subject in general, both natural and
revealed: taking for proved, that there is an intelligent Author
of nature, and natural Governor of the world. For as there is no
presumption against this prior to the proof of it: so it has been
often proved with accumulated evidence; from this argument of
analogy and final causes; from abstract reasonings; from the
most ancient tradition and testimony; and from the general consent
of mankind. Nor does it appear, so far as I can find, to be
denied by the generality of those who profess themselves dissatisfied
with the evidence of religion.</p>

<p>As there are some, who, instead of thus attending to what is
in fact the constitution of nature, form their notions of God’s
government upon hypothesis: so there are others, who indulge
themselves in vain and idle speculations, how the world might
possibly have been framed otherwise than it is; and upon supposition
that things might, in imagining that they should, have
been disposed and carried on after a better model, than what appears
in the present disposition and conduct of them.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Suppose
now a person of such a turn of mind, to go on with his reveries,
till he had at length fixed upon some particular plan of nature,
as appearing to him the best.&mdash;One shall scarce be thought guilty
of detraction against human understanding, if one should say,
even beforehand, that the plan which this speculative person
would fix upon, though he were the wisest of the sons of men,
probably would not be the very best, even according to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
notions of <em>best</em>; whether he thought that to be so, which afforded
occasions and motives for the exercise of the greatest virtue, or
which was productive of the greatest happiness, or that these two
were necessarily connected, and run up into one and the same
plan.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss, once for all, to see what would be the
amount of these emendations and imaginary improvements upon
the system of nature, or how far they would mislead us. It
seems there could be no stopping, till we came to some such conclusions
as these: that all creatures should at first be made as
perfect and as happy as they were capable of ever being: that
nothing, surely, of hazard or danger should be put upon them to
do; some indolent persons would perhaps think nothing at all:
or certainly, that effectual care should be taken, that they should,
whether necessarily or not, yet eventually and in fact, always do
what was right and most conducive to happiness; which would
be thought easy for infinite power to effect, either by not giving
them any principles which would endanger their going wrong, or
by laying the right motive of action in every instance before their
minds in so strong a manner, as would never fail of inducing
them to act conformably to it: and that the whole method of government
by punishments should be rejected as absurd; as an
awkward roundabout method of carrying things on; nay, as contrary
to a principal purpose, for which it would be supposed
creatures were made, namely, happiness.</p>

<p>Now, without considering what is to be said in particular to
the several parts of this train of folly and extravagance, what has
been above intimated, is a full direct general answer to it; namely,
that we may see beforehand that we have not faculties for this
kind of speculation. For though it be admitted that, from the
first principles of our nature, we unavoidably judge or determine
some ends to be absolutely in themselves preferable to others, and
that the ends now mentioned, or if they run up into one, that
this one is absolutely the best; and consequently that we must
conclude the ultimate end designed, in the constitution of nature
and conduct of Providence, is the most virtue and happiness possible;
yet we are far from being able to judge what particular
disposition of things would be most friendly and assistant to virtue;
or what means might be absolutely necessary to produce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
most happiness in a system of such extent as our own world may
be, taking in all that is past and to come, though we should suppose
it detached from the whole things. Indeed we are so far
from being able to judge of this, that we are not judges what
may be the necessary means of raising and conducting one person
to the highest perfection and happiness of his nature. Nay,
even in the little affairs of the present life, we find men of different
educations and ranks are not competent judges of the conduct
of each other. Our whole nature leads us to ascribe all
moral perfection to God, and to deny all imperfection of him.
And this will forever be a practical proof of his moral character,
to such as will consider what a practical proof is; because it is
the voice of God speaking in us. Hence we conclude, that virtue
must be the happiness, and vice the misery, of every creature;
and that regularity and order and right cannot but prevail finally
in a universe under his government. But we are in no sort
judges, what are the necessary means of accomplishing this end.</p>

<p>Let us then, instead of that idle and not very innocent employment
of forming imaginary models of a world, and schemes
of governing it, turn our thoughts to what we experience to be
the conduct of nature with respect to intelligent creatures; which
may be resolved into general laws or rules of administration, in
the same way as many of the laws of nature respecting inanimate
matter may be collected from experiments. Let us compare the
known constitution and course of things with what is said to be
the moral system of nature; the acknowledged dispensations of
Providence, or that government which we find ourselves under,
with what religion teaches us to believe and expect; and see
whether they are not analogous and of a piece. Upon such a
comparison it will, I think, be found that they are very much
so: that both may be traced up to the same general laws, and
resolved into the same principles of divine conduct.</p>

<p>The analogy here proposed to be considered is of pretty large
extent, and consists of several parts; in some more, in others less
exact. In some few instances perhaps, it may amount to a real
practical proof; in others not so. Yet in these it is a confirmation
of what is proved otherwise. It will undeniably show, what
too many need to have shown them, that the system of religion,
both natural and revealed, considered only as a system, and prior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the proof of it, is not a subject of ridicule, unless that of nature
be so too. And it will afford an answer to almost all objections
against the system both of natural and revealed religion;
though not perhaps an answer in so great a degree, yet in a very
considerable degree an answer to the objections against the evidence
of it: for objections against a proof, and objections against
what is said to be proved, the reader will observe are different
things.</p>

<p>The divine government of the world, implied in the notion of
religion in general and of Christianity, contains in it: that mankind
is appointed to live in a future state;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that there every one
shall be rewarded or punished;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> rewarded or punished respectively
for all that behaviour here, which we comprehend under the
words, virtuous or vicious, morally good or evil:<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that our present
life is a probation, a state of trial,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and of discipline,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> for
that future one; notwithstanding the objections, which men may
fancy they have, from notions of necessity, against there being
any such moral plan as this at all;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and whatever objections may
appear to lie against the wisdom and goodness of it, as it stands so
imperfectly made known to us at present:<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that this world being
in a state of apostasy and wickedness, and consequently of ruin,
and the sense both of their condition and duty being greatly corrupted
amongst men, this gave occasion for an additional dispensation
of Providence; of the utmost importance;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> proved by miracles;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
but containing in it many things appearing to us strange,
and not to have been expected;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> a dispensation of Providence,
which is a scheme or system of things;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> carried on by the mediation
of a divine person, the Messiah, in order to the recovery of
the world;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> yet not revealed to all men, nor proved with the
strongest possible evidence to all those to whom it is revealed;
but only to such a part of mankind, and with such particular
evidence, as the wisdom of God thought fit.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The design then of the following treatise will be to show, that
the several parts principally objected against in this moral and
Christian dispensation, including its scheme, its publication, and
the proof which God has afforded us of its truth; that the particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
parts principally objected against in this whole dispensation,
are analogous to what is experienced in the constitution and
course of nature or Providence; that the chief objections themselves
which are alleged against the former, are no other than
what may be alleged with like justness against the latter, where
they are found in fact to be inconclusive; and that this argument
from analogy is in general unanswerable, and undoubtedly
of weight on the side of religion,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> notwithstanding the objections
which may seem to lie against it, and the real ground which there
may be for difference of opinion, as to the particular degree of
weight which is to be laid upon it. This is a general account of
what may be looked for in the following treatise. I shall begin
it with that which is the foundation of all our hopes and of all
our fears; all our hopes and fears, which are of any consideration;
I mean a future life.</p>

<p>Strange difficulties have been raised by some concerning personal
identity, or the sameness of living agents, implied in the
notion of our existing now and hereafter, or in any two successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
moments; which, whoever thinks it worth while, may see
considered in the first dissertation at the end of this treatise.
But without regard to any of them here, let us consider what the
analogy of nature, and the several changes which we have undergone,
and those which we know we may undergo without being
destroyed, suggest, as to the effect which death may, or may not,
have upon us; and whether it be not from thence probable, that
we may survive this change, and exist in a future state of life
and perception.</p>

<p>I. From our being born into the present world in the helpless
imperfect state of infancy, and having arrived from thence to
mature age, we find it to be a general law of nature in our own
species, that the same creatures, the <em>same individuals</em>, should
exist in degrees of life and perception, with capacities of action,
of enjoyment and suffering, in one period of their being, greatly
different from those appointed them in another period of it. In
other creatures the same law holds. For the difference of their
capacities and states of life at their birth (to go no higher) and
in maturity; the change of worms into flies, and the vast enlargement
of their locomotive powers by such change: and birds and
insects bursting the shell of their habitation, and by this means
entering into a new world, furnished with new accommodations
for them, and finding a new sphere of action assigned them;
these are instances of this general law of nature. Thus all the
various and wonderful transformations of animals are to be taken
into consideration here. The states of life in which we ourselves
existed formerly, in the womb and in our infancy, are almost as
different from our present in mature age, as it is possible to conceive
any two states or degrees of life can be. Therefore that we
are to exist hereafter, in a state as different (suppose) from our
present, as this is from our former, is but according to the analogy
of nature; according to a natural order or appointment of the very
same kind, with what we have already experienced.</p>

<p>II. We know we are endued with capacities of action, of happiness
and misery: for we are conscious of acting, of enjoying
pleasure and suffering pain. Now that we have these powers and
capacities before death, is a presumption that we shall retain
them through and after death; indeed a probability of it abundantly
sufficient to act upon, unless there be some positive reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to think that death is the destruction of those living powers; because
there is in every case a probability, that all things will continue
as we experience they are, in all respects, except those in
which we have some reason to think they will be altered. This
is that <em>kind</em><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of presumption or probability from analogy, expressed
in the very word <em>continuance</em>, which seems our only natural
reason for believing the course of the world will continue
to-morrow, as it has done so far as our experience or knowledge
of history can carry us back. Nay, it seems our only reason for
believing, that any one substance now existing will continue to
exist a moment longer; the self-existent substance only excepted.
Thus if men were assured that the unknown event, death, was
not the destruction of our faculties of perception and of action,
there would be no apprehension that any other power or event,
unconnected with this of death, would destroy these faculties just
at the instant of each creature’s death; and therefore no doubt
but that they would remain after it; which shows the high probability
that our living powers will continue after death, unless
there be some ground to think that death is their destruction.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
For, if it would be in a manner certain that we should survive
death,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> provided it were certain that death would not be
our destruction, it must be highly probable we shall survive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
it, if there be no ground to think death will be our destruction.</p>

<p>Though I think it must be acknowledged, that prior to the
natural and moral proofs of a future life commonly insisted upon,
there would arise a general confused suspicion, that in the great
shock and alteration which we shall undergo by death, we, <i>i.e.</i>
our living powers, might be wholly destroyed; yet even prior to
those proofs, there is really no particular distinct ground or reason
for this apprehension at all, so far as I can find. If there be, it
must arise either from <em>the reason of the thing</em>, or from <em>the analogy
of nature</em>.</p>

<p>But we cannot argue from <em>the reason of the thing</em>, that death
is the destruction of living agents, because we know not at all
what death is in itself; but only some of its effects, such as the
dissolution of flesh, skin, and bones. These effects do in no wise
appear to imply the destruction of a living agent. Besides, as
we are greatly in the dark, upon what the exercise of our living
powers depends, so we are wholly ignorant what the powers themselves
depend upon; the powers themselves as distinguished, not
only from their actual exercise, but also from the present capacity
of exercising them; and as opposed to their destruction: for
sleep, or certainly a swoon, shows us, not only that these powers
exist when they are not exercised, as the passive power of motion
does in inanimate matter; but shows also that they exist, when
there is no present capacity of exercising them: or that the capacities
of exercising them for the present, as well as the actual
exercise of them, may be suspended, and yet the powers themselves
remain undestroyed. Since then we know not at all upon
what the existence of our living powers depends, this shows further,
there can no probability be collected from the reason of the
thing, that death will be their destruction: because their existence
may depend upon somewhat in no degree affected by death;
upon somewhat quite out of the reach of this king of terrors.
So that there is nothing more certain, than that <em>the reason of the
thing</em> shows us no connection between death and the destruction
of living agents.</p>

<p>Nor can we find any thing throughout the whole <em>analogy of
nature</em> to afford us even the slightest presumption, that animals
ever lose their living powers; much less if it were possible, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they lose them by death: for we have no faculties wherewith to
trace any beyond or through it, so as to see what becomes of
them. This event removes them from our view. It destroys
the <em>sensible</em> proof, which we had before their death, of their being
possessed of living powers, but does not appear to afford the least
reason to believe that they are, then, or by that event, deprived
of them.</p>

<p>Our knowing that they were possessed of these powers, up to
the very period to which we have faculties capable of tracing
them, is itself a probability of their retaining them beyond it.
This is confirmed, and a sensible credibility is given to it, by observing
the very great and astonishing changes which we have
experienced; so great, that our existence in another state of life,
of perception and of action, will be but according to a method of
providential conduct, the like to which has been already exercised
even with regard to ourselves; according to a course of
nature, the like to which we have already gone through.</p>

<p>However, as one cannot but be greatly sensible, how difficult
it is to silence imagination enough to make the voice of reason
even distinctly heard in this case; as we are accustomed, from
our youth up, to indulge that forward, delusive faculty, ever obtruding
beyond its sphere; (of some assistance indeed to apprehension,
but the author of all error,) as we plainly lose ourselves
in gross and crude conceptions of things, taking for granted that
we are acquainted with what indeed we are wholly ignorant of:
it may be proper to consider the imaginary presumptions, that
death will be our destruction, arising from these kinds of early
and lasting prejudices; and to show how little they really amount
to, even though we cannot wholly divest ourselves of them.
And,</p>

<p>I. All presumption of death’s being the destruction of living
beings, must go upon supposition that they are compounded;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
so, discerptible. But since consciousness is a single and indivisible
power, it should seem that the subject in which it resides
must be so too. For were the motion of any particle of matter
absolutely one and indivisible, so as that it should imply a contradiction
to suppose part of this motion to exist, and part not
to exist, <i>i.e.</i> part of this matter to move, and part to be at rest,
then its power of motion would be indivisible; and so also would
the subject in which the power inheres, namely, the particle of
matter: for if this could be divided into two, one part might
be moved and the other at rest, which is contrary to the supposition.</p>

<p>In like manner it has been argued,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and, for any thing appearing
to the contrary, justly, that since the perception or consciousness,
which we have of our own existence, is indivisible, so
as that it is a contradiction to suppose one part of it should be
here and the other there; the perceptive power, or the power of
consciousness, is indivisible too: and consequently the subject in
which it resides, <i>i.e.</i> the conscious being. Now, upon supposition
that the living agent each man calls himself, is thus a single
being, which there is at least no more difficulty in conceiving
than in conceiving it to be a compound, and of which there is the
proof now mentioned; it follows, that our organized bodies are no
more ourselves or part of ourselves, than any other matter around
us. And it is as easy to conceive, how matter, which is no part
of ourselves, may be appropriated to us in the manner which our
present bodies are; as how we can receive impressions from, and
have power over, any matter. It is as easy to conceive, that we may
exist out of bodies, as in them; and that we might have animated
bodies of any other organs and senses wholly different from these
now given us; and that we may hereafter animate these same or
new bodies, variously modified and organized; as to conceive how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
we can animate such bodies as our present. And lastly, the dissolution
of all these several organized bodies, supposing ourselves
to have successively animated them, would have no more conceivable
tendency to destroy the living beings ourselves, or deprive
us of living faculties, the faculties of perception and of
action, than the dissolution of any foreign matter, which we are
capable of receiving impressions from, and making use of, for the
common occasions of life.</p>

<p>II. The simplicity and absolute oneness of a living agent cannot,
from the nature of the thing, be properly proved by experimental
observations. But as these <em>fall in</em> with the supposition
of its unity, so they plainly lead us to <em>conclude</em> certainly, that our
gross organized bodies, with which we perceive objects of sense,
and with which we act, are no part of ourselves; and therefore
show us, that we have no reason to believe their destruction to be
ours: even without determining whether our living substance be
material or immaterial. For we see by experience, that men may
lose their limbs, their organs of sense, and even the greatest part
of these bodies, and yet remain the same living agents. Persons
can trace up the existence of themselves to a time, when the bulk
of their bodies was extremely small, in comparison of what it is
in mature age: and we cannot but think, that they might <em>then</em>
have lost a considerable part of that small body, and yet have remained
the same living agents; as they may now lose great part
of their present body, and remain so. And it is certain, that the
bodies of all animals are in a constant flux;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> from that never-ceasing
attrition, which there is in every part of them. Now,
things of this kind unavoidably teach us to distinguish, between
these living agents ourselves, and large quantities of matter, in
which we are very nearly interested; since these may be alienated,
and actually are in a daily course of succession, and changing
their owners; whilst we are assured, that each living agent remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
one and the same permanent being.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And this general
observation leads us on to the following ones.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That we have no way of determining by experience,
what is the certain bulk of the living being each man calls himself:
and yet, till it be determined that it is larger in bulk than
the solid elementary particles of matter, which there is no ground
to think any natural power can dissolve, there is no sort of reason
to think death to be the dissolution of it, of the living being,
even though it should not be absolutely indiscerptible.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, From our being so nearly related to and interested
in certain systems of matter, (suppose our flesh and bones,) and
afterwards ceasing to be at all related to them, the living agents,
ourselves, remaining all this while undestroyed notwithstanding
such alienation; and consequently these systems of matter not
being ourselves, it follows further that we have no ground to
conclude any other (suppose <em>internal</em>) <em>systems</em> of matter, to be
the living agents ourselves; because we can have no ground to
conclude this, but from our relation to and interest in such other
systems of matter: and therefore we can have no reason to conclude
what befalls those systems of matter at death, to be the
destruction of the living agents. We have already several times
over, lost a great part or perhaps the whole of our body, according
to certain common established laws of nature, yet we remain
the same living agents. When we shall lose as great a part, or the
whole, by another common established law of nature, death, why
may we not also remain the same? That the alienation has been
gradual in one case, and in the other will be more at once, does
not prove any thing to the contrary. We have passed undestroyed
through those many and great revolutions of matter, so peculiarly
appropriated to us ourselves; why should we imagine death will
be so fatal to us? Nor can it be objected, that what is thus
alienated or lost, is no part of our original solid body, but only
adventitious matter. Because we may lose entire limbs, which
must have contained many solid parts and vessels of the original
body; or if this be not admitted, we have no proof, that any of
these solid parts are dissolved or alienated by death. Though we
are very nearly related to that extraneous or adventitious matter,
whilst it continues united to and distending the several parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
our solid body, yet after all, the relation a person bears to those
parts of his body, to which he is most nearly related, amounts but
to this, that the living agent, and those parts of the body, mutually
affect each other.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The same thing, the same thing in kind
though not in degree, may be said of <em>all foreign</em> matter, which
gives us ideas, and over which we have any power. From these
observations the whole ground of the imagination is removed,
that the dissolution of any matter, is the destruction of a living
agent, from the interest he once had in such matter.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, If we consider our body somewhat more distinctly,
as made up of organs and instruments of perception and of motion,
it will bring us to the same conclusion. Thus the common
optical experiments show, and even the observation how sight is
assisted by glasses shows, that we see with our eyes in the same
sense as we see with glasses. Nor is there any reason to believe,
that we see with them in any other sense; any other, I mean,
which would lead us to think the eye itself a percipient. The like
is to be said of hearing; and our feeling distant solid matter by
means of something in our hand, seems an instance of the like
kind, as to the subject we are considering. All these are instances
of foreign matter, or such as is no part of our body,
being instrumental in preparing objects for, and conveying them
to, the perceiving power, in a manner similar to the manner in
which our organs of sense prepare and convey them. Both are
in a like way instruments of our receiving such ideas from external
objects, as the Author of nature appointed those external
objects to be the occasions of exciting in us. Glasses are evident
instances of this; namely of matter which is no part of our
body, preparing objects for and conveying them towards the perceiving
power, in like manner as our bodily organs do. And if
we see with our eyes only in the same manner as we do with
glasses, the like may justly be concluded, from analogy, of all
our other senses. It is not intended, by any thing here said, to
affirm, that the whole apparatus of vision, or of perception by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
any other sense, can be traced through all its steps, quite up to
the <em>living power</em> of seeing, or perceiving: but that so far as it
can be traced by experimental observations, so far it appears, that
our organs of sense prepare and convey objects, in order to their
being perceived, in like manner as foreign matter does, without
affording any shadow of appearance, that they themselves perceive.
And that we have no reason to think our organs of sense
percipients, is confirmed by instances of persons losing some of
them, the living beings themselves, their former occupiers, remaining
unimpaired. It is confirmed also by the experience of
dreams; by which we find we are at present possessed of a latent,
and what would be otherwise an unimagined unknown power of
perceiving sensible objects, in as strong and lively a manner without
our external organs of sense, as with them.</p>

<p>So also with regard to our power of moving, or directing
motion by will and choice; upon the destruction of a limb, this
active power evidently remains, unlessened; so that the living
being, who has suffered this loss, would be capable of moving as
before, if it had another limb to move with. It can walk by the
help of an artificial leg. It can make use of a pole or a lever,
to reach towards itself and to move things, beyond the length
and the power of its arm; and this it does in the same manner
as it reaches and moves, with its natural arm, things nearer and
of less weight. Nor is there so much as any appearance of our
limbs being endued with a power of moving or directing themselves;
though they are adapted, like the several parts of a
machine, to be the instruments of motion to each other; and
some parts of the same limb, to be instruments of motion to the
other parts.</p>

<p>Thus a man determines that he will look at an object through
a microscope; or being lame, that he will walk to such a
place with a staff, a week hence. His eyes and his feet no
more determine in these cases, than the microscope and the staff.
Nor is there any ground to think they any more put the determination
in practice; or that his eyes are the seers, or his feet the
movers, in any other sense than as the microscope and the staff
are. Upon the whole, then, our organs of sense, and our limbs,
are certainly <em>instruments</em>,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which the living persons ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
make use of to perceive and move with: there is not any probability,
that they are any more; nor consequently, that we have
any other kind of relation to them, than what we have to any
other foreign matter formed into instruments of perception and
motion, suppose into a microscope or a staff; (I say any other kind
of relation, for I am not speaking of the degree of it) nor consequently
is there any probability, that the alienation or dissolution
of these instruments, is the destruction of the perceiving
and moving agent.</p>

<p>And thus our finding that the dissolution of matter, in which
living beings were most nearly interested, is not their dissolution;
and that the destruction of several of the organs and instruments
of perception and of motion belonging to them, is not their
destruction; shows demonstratively, that there is no ground to
think that the dissolution of any other matter, or destruction of
any other organs and instruments, will be the dissolution or
destruction of living agents, from the like kind of relation. And
we have no reason to think we stand in any other kind of relation
to any thing which we find dissolved by death.</p>

<p>But it is said, these observations are equally applicable to
brutes:<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and it is thought an insuperable difficulty, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
should be immortal, and by consequence capable of everlasting
happiness. Now this manner of expression is both invidious and
weak: but the thing intended by it, is really no difficulty at all,
either in the way of natural or moral consideration. For 1, Suppose
the invidious thing, designed in such a manner of expression,
were really implied, as it is not in the least, in the natural
immortality of brutes, namely, that they must arrive at great
attainments, and become rational and moral agents; even this
would be no difficulty, since we know not what latent powers and
capacities they may be endued with. There was once, prior to
experience, as great presumption against human creatures, as
there is against the brute creatures, arriving at that degree of
understanding, which we have in mature age. For we can trace
up our own existence to the same original with theirs. We find
it to be a general law of nature, that creatures endued with
<em>capacities</em> of virtue and religion should be placed in a condition
of being, in which they are altogether without <em>the use</em> of them,
for a considerable length of their duration; as in infancy and
childhood. And great part of the human species, go out of the
present world, before they come to the exercise of these capacities
in <em>any</em> degree.</p>

<p>2. The natural immortality of brutes does not in the least
imply, that they are endued with any latent capacities of a
rational or <em>moral</em> nature. The economy of the universe might require,
that there should be living creatures without any capacities
of this kind. And all difficulties as to the manner how they are
to be disposed of, are so apparently and wholly founded in our
ignorance, that it is wonderful they should be insisted upon by
any, but such as are weak enough to think they are acquainted
with the whole system of things. There is then absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
nothing at all in this objection, which is so rhetorically urged,
against the greatest part of the natural proofs or presumptions of
the immortality of human minds; I say the greatest part, for it
is less applicable to the following observation, which is more
peculiar to mankind.</p>

<p>III. As it is evident our <em>present</em> powers and capacities of
reason, memory, and affection, do not depend upon our gross
body in the manner in which perception by our organs of sense
does; so they do not appear to depend upon it at all, in any such
manner as to give ground to think, that the dissolution of this
body will be the destruction of these our present powers of reflection,
as it will of our powers of sensation; or to give ground
to conclude, even that it will be so much as a suspension of the
former.</p>

<p>Human creatures exist at present in two states of life and perception,
greatly different from each other; each of which has its
own peculiar laws, and its own peculiar enjoyments and sufferings.
When any of our senses are affected, or appetites gratified
with the objects of them, we may be said to exist or live in a
state of sensation. When none of our senses are affected or
appetites gratified, and yet we perceive, and reason, and act, we
may be said to exist or live in a state of reflection. Now it is
by no means certain, that any thing which is dissolved by death,
is in any way necessary to the living being, in this its state of
reflection, <em>after</em> ideas are gained. For, though, from our present
constitution and condition of being, our external organs of sense
are necessary for conveying in ideas to our reflecting powers, as
carriages, and levers, and scaffolds are in architecture:<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> yet when
these ideas are brought in, we are capable of reflecting in the
most intense degree, and of enjoying the greatest pleasure, and
feeling the greatest pain, by means of that reflection, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
any assistance from our senses; and without any at all, which we
know of, from that body which will be dissolved by death. It
does not appear then, that the relation of this gross body to the
reflecting being is, in any degree, necessary to thinking; to intellectual
enjoyments or sufferings: nor, consequently, that the
dissolution or alienation of the former by death, will be the
destruction of those present powers, which render us capable of
this state of reflection.</p>

<p>Further, there are instances of mortal diseases, which do not
at all affect our present intellectual powers; and this affords a
presumption, that those diseases will not destroy these present
powers. Indeed, from the observations made above,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> it appears,
that there is no presumption, from their mutually affecting each
other, that the dissolution of the body is the destruction of the
living agent. By the same reasoning, it must appear too, that
there is no presumption, from their mutually affecting each other,
that the dissolution of the body is the destruction of our present
reflecting powers: indeed instances of their not affecting each
other, afford a presumption of the contrary. Instances of mortal
diseases not impairing our present reflecting powers, evidently
turn our thoughts even from imagining such diseases to be the
destruction of them. Several things indeed greatly affect all our
living powers, and at length suspend the exercise of them; as
for instance drowsiness, increasing till it ends in sound sleep:
and hence we might have imagined it would destroy them, till
we found by experience the weakness of this way of judging.
But in the diseases now mentioned, there is not so much as this
shadow of probability, to lead us to any such conclusion, as to
the reflecting powers which we have at present. For in those
diseases, persons the moment before death appear to be in the
highest vigor of life. They discover apprehension, memory,
reason, all entire; the utmost force of affection; a sense of character,
of shame and honor; and the highest mental enjoyments
and sufferings, even to the last gasp. These surely prove even
greater vigor of life than bodily strength does. Now what pretence
is there for thinking, that a progressive disease when
arrived to such a degree, I mean that degree which is mortal,
will destroy those powers, which were not impaired, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
not affected by it, during its whole progress quite up to that
degree? And if death by diseases of this kind, is not the
destruction of our present reflecting powers, it will scarce be
thought that death by any other means is.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this general observation may be carried
further. There appears to be so little connection between our
bodily powers of sensation, and our present powers of reflection,
that there is no reason to conclude, that death, which destroys
the former, does so much as <em>suspend the exercise</em> of the latter, or
interrupt our <em>continuing</em> to exist in the like state of reflection
which we do now.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> For suspension of reason, memory, and the
affections which they excite, is no part of the idea of death, nor
implied in our notion of it. Our daily experiencing these powers
to be exercised, without any assistance, that we know of, from
those bodies which will be dissolved by death; and our finding
often, that the exercise of them is so lively to the last; afford a
sensible apprehension, that death may not perhaps be so much as
a discontinuance of the exercise of these powers, nor of the
enjoyments and sufferings which it implies.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> So that our posthumous
life, whatever there may be in it additional to our present,
may yet not be beginning entirely anew; but going on. Death
may, in some sort and in some respects, answer to our birth;
which is not a suspension of the faculties which we had before
it, or a <em>total</em> change of the state of life in which we existed when
in the womb; but a continuation of both, with such and such
great alterations.</p>

<p>Nay, for aught we know of ourselves, of our present life and
of death, death may immediately, in the natural course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
things, put us into a higher and more enlarged state of life, as
our birth does;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> a state in which our capacities; and sphere of
perception and of action, may be much greater than at present.
For as our relation to our external organs of sense, renders us
capable of existing in our present state of sensation; so it may
be the only natural hinderance to our existing, immediately, and
of course; in a <em>higher</em> state of reflection. The truth is, reason
does not at all show us, in what state death naturally leaves us.
But were we sure, that it would suspend all our perceptive and
active powers; yet the suspension of a power and the destruction
of it, are effects so totally different in kind, as we experience
from sleep and a swoon, that we cannot in any wise argue from
one to the other; or conclude even to the lowest degree of probability,
that the same kind of force which is sufficient to suspend
our faculties, though it be increased ever so much, will be
sufficient to destroy them.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>These observations together may be sufficient to show, how
little presumption there is, that death is the destruction of
human creatures. However, there is the shadow of an analogy,
which may lead us to imagine it,&mdash;viz.: the supposed likeness
which is observed between the decay of vegetables, and of living
creatures. This likeness is indeed sufficient to afford the poets
very apt allusions to the flowers of the field, in their pictures of
the frailty of our present life. But in reason, the analogy is so
far from holding, that there appears no ground for the comparison,
as to the present question; because one of the two subjects
compared is wholly void of that, which is the principal and
chief thing in the other; the power of perception and of action;
which is the only thing we are inquiring about the continuance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of. So that the destruction of a vegetable, is an event not
similar or analogous to the destruction of a living agent.</p>

<p>If, as was above intimated, leaving off the delusive custom of
substituting imagination in the room of experience, we would
confine ourselves to what we do know and understand; if we
would argue only from that, and from that form our expectations,
it would appear at first sight, that as no probability of living
beings ever ceasing to be so, can be concluded from the reason
of the thing, so none can be collected from the analogy of
nature; because we cannot trace any living beings beyond death.
But as we are conscious that we are endued with capacities of
perception and of action, and are living persons; what we are to
go upon is, that we shall continue so, till we foresee some accident
or event, which will endanger those capacities, or be likely
to destroy us: which death does in no wise appear to be.</p>

<p>Thus, when we go out of this world, we may pass into new
scenes, and a new state of life and action, just as naturally as we
came into the present. And this new state may naturally be a
social one.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And the advantages of it, advantages, of every kind,
may naturally be bestowed, according to some fixed general laws
of wisdom, upon every one in proportion to the degrees of his
virtue. And though the advantages of that future natural state
should not be bestowed, as these of the present in some measure
are, by the will of the society; but entirely by his more immediate
action, upon whom the whole frame of nature depends: yet
this distribution may be just as natural, as their being distributed
here by the instrumentality of men. Indeed, though one should
allow any confused undetermined sense, which people please to
put upon the word <em>natural</em>, it would be a shortness of thought
scarce credible, to imagine, that no system or course of things
can be so, but only what we see at present:<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> especially whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
probability of a future life, or the natural immortality of the
soul, is admitted upon the evidence of reason; because this is
really both admitting and denying at once, a state of being different
from the present to be natural. But the only distinct meaning
of that word is, <em>stated</em>, <em>fixed</em>, or <em>settled</em>; since what is natural
as much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render
it so, <i>i.e.</i> to effect it continually, or at stated times, as what is
supernatural or miraculous does to effect it for once.</p>

<p>Hence it must follow, that persons’ notion of what is natural,
will be enlarged in proportion to their greater knowledge of the
works of God, and the dispensations of his providence. Nor is
there any absurdity in supposing, that there may be beings in the
universe, whose capacities, and knowledge, and views, may be so
extensive, as that the whole Christian dispensation may to them
appear natural, <i>i.e.</i> analogous or conformable to God’s dealings
with other parts of his creation; as natural as the visible known
course of things appears to us. For there seems scarce any other
possible sense to be put upon the word, but that only in which it
is here used; similar, stated, or uniform.</p>

<p>This credibility of a future life, which has been here insisted
upon, how little soever it may satisfy our curiosity, seems to
answer all the purposes of religion, in like manner as a demonstrative
proof would. Indeed a proof, even a demonstrative one, of
a future life, would not be a proof of religion. For, that we are
to live hereafter, is just as reconcilable with the scheme of
atheism, and as well to be accounted for by it, as that we are
now alive is: and therefore nothing can be more absurd than to
argue from that scheme, that there can be no future state.
But as religion implies a future state, any presumption against
such a state, is a presumption against religion. The foregoing
observations remove all presumptions of that sort, and prove, to
a very considerable degree of probability, one fundamental doctrine
of religion; which, if believed, would greatly open and
dispose the mind seriously to attend to the general evidence!
of the whole.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD BY REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.</span></h3>

<p>That which makes the question concerning a future life to be
of so great importance to us, is our capacity of happiness and
misery. And that which makes the consideration of it to be of
so great importance to us, is the supposition of our happiness and
misery hereafter depending upon our actions here. Indeed,
without this, curiosity could not but sometimes bring a subject,
in which we may be so highly interested, to our thoughts; especially
upon the mortality of others, or the near prospect of our
own. But reasonable men would not take any further thought
about hereafter, than what should happen thus occasionally to
rise in their minds, if it were certain that our future interest no
way depended upon our present behavior; whereas, on the contrary,
if there be ground, either from analogy or any thing else,
to think it does, then there is reason also for the most active
thought and solicitude, to secure that interest; to behave so as
that we may escape that misery, and obtain that happiness, in
another life, which we not only suppose ourselves capable of, but
which we apprehend also is put in our own power. And whether
there be ground for this last apprehension, certainly would deserve
to be most seriously considered, were there no other proof of a
future life and interest, than that presumptive one, which the
foregoing observations amount to.</p>

<p>In the present state, all which we enjoy, and a great part of
what we suffer, <em>is put in our own power</em>. Pleasure and pain are
the consequences of our actions; and we are endued by the
Author of our nature with capacities of foreseeing these consequences.
We find by experience that he does not so much as
preserve our lives, exclusive of our own care and attention, to
provide ourselves with, and to make use of, that sustenance, by
which he has appointed our lives shall be preserved; and without
which, he has appointed, they shall not be preserved. In
general we foresee, that the external things, which are the objects
of our various passions, can neither be obtained nor enjoyed,
without exerting ourselves in such and such manners: but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thus exerting ourselves, we obtain and enjoy these objects, in
which our natural good consists; or by this means God gives us
the possession and enjoyment of them. I know not, that we have
any one kind or degree of enjoyment, but by the means of our
own actions. By prudence and care, we may, for the most part,
pass our days in tolerable ease and quiet: on the contrary, we
may, by rashness, ungoverned passion, wilfulness, or even by
negligence, make ourselves as miserable as ever we please. And
many do please to make themselves extremely miserable, <i>i.e.</i> to
do what they know beforehand will render them so. They follow
those ways, the fruit of which they know, by instruction, example,
and experience, will be disgrace, and poverty, and sickness,
and untimely death. This every one observes to be the general
course of things; though it is to be allowed, we cannot find by
experience, that <em>all</em> our sufferings are owing to our own follies.</p>

<p>Why the Author of nature does not give his creatures promiscuously
such and such perceptions, without regard to their
behavior; why he does not make them happy without the instrumentality
of their own actions, and prevent their bringing any
sufferings upon themselves, is another matter.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Perhaps there
may be some impossibilities in the nature of things, which we are
unacquainted with.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Or less happiness, it may be, would upon
the whole be produced by such a method of conduct, than is by
the present. Or perhaps divine goodness, with which, if I mistake
not, we make very free in our speculations, may not be a
bare single disposition to produce happiness; but a disposition to
make the good, the faithful, the honest, happy. Perhaps an
infinitely perfect mind may be pleased with seeing his creatures
behave suitably to the nature which he has given them; to the
relations which he has placed them in to each other; and to that
which they stand in to himself: that relation to himself, which,
during their existence, is even necessary,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and which is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
important one of all: perhaps, I say, an infinitely perfect mind
may be pleased with this moral piety of moral agents, in and for
itself; as well as upon account of its being essentially conducive
to the happiness of his creation. Or the whole end, for which
God made, and thus governs the world, may be utterly beyond
the reach of our faculties: there may be somewhat in it as impossible
for us to have any conception of, as for a blind man to
have a conception of colors. However this be, it is certain
matter of universal experience, that the general method of divine
administration is, forewarning us, or giving us capacities to foresee,
with more or less clearness, that if we act so and so, we shall
have such enjoyments, if so and so, such sufferings; and giving
us those enjoyments, and making us feel those sufferings, in
consequence of our actions.</p>

<p>“But all this is to be ascribed to the general course of nature,”
True. This is the very thing which I am observing. It is to be
ascribed to the general course of nature: <i>i.e.</i> not surely to the
words or ideas, <em>course of nature</em>; but to Him who appointed it,
and put things into it; or to a course of operation, from its
uniformity or constancy, called natural;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and which necessarily
implies an operating agent. For when men find themselves
necessitated to confess an Author of nature, or that God is the
natural governor of the world, they must not deny this again,
because his government is uniform. They must not deny that
he does things at all, because he does them constantly,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> because
the effects of his acting are permanent, whether his acting be so
or not; though there is no reason to think it is not. In short,
every man, in every thing he does, naturally acts upon the forethought
and apprehension of avoiding evil or obtaining good:
and if the natural course of things be the appointment of God,
and our natural faculties of knowledge and experience are given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
us by him, then the good and bad consequences which follow our
actions, are his appointment, and our foresight of those consequences,
is a warning given us by him, how we are to act.</p>

<p>“Is the pleasure then, naturally accompanying every particular
gratification of passion, intended to put us upon gratifying ourselves
in every such particular instance, and as a reward to us for
so doing?” No, certainly. Nor is it to be said, that our eyes
were naturally intended to give us the sight of each particular
object, to which they do or can extend; objects which are destructive
of them, or which, for any other reason, it may become
us to turn our eyes from. Yet there is no doubt, but that our
eyes were intended for us to see with.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> So neither is there any
doubt, but that the foreseen pleasures and pains belonging to the
passions, were intended, in general, to induce mankind to act in
such and such manners.</p>

<p>From this general observation, obvious to every one, (that God
has given us to understand, he has appointed satisfaction and
delight to be the consequence of our acting in one manner, and
pain and uneasiness of our acting in another, and of our not acting
at all; and that we find these consequences, which we were
beforehand informed of, uniformly to follow;) we may learn, that
we are at present actually under his government in the strictest
and most proper sense; in such a sense, as that he rewards and
punishes us for our actions.</p>

<p>An Author of nature being supposed, it is not so much a
deduction of reason, as a matter of experience, that we are
thus under his government; under his government, in the same
sense, as we are under the government of civil magistrates.
Because the annexing of pleasure to some actions, and pain to
others, in our power to do or forbear, and giving notice of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
appointment beforehand to those whom it concerns, is the proper
formal notion of government.</p>

<p>Whether the pleasure or pain which thus follows upon our
behavior, be owing to the Author of nature’s acting upon us
every moment which we feel it; or to his having at once contrived
and executed his own part in the plan of the world;
makes no alteration as to the matter before us. For if civil
magistrates could make the sanctions of their laws take place,
without interposing at all, after they had passed them; without
a trial, and the formalities of an execution: if they were
able to make their laws <em>execute themselves</em>, or every offender to
execute them upon himself; we should be just in the same sense
under their government then, as we are now; but in a much
higher degree, and more perfect manner.</p>

<p>Vain is the ridicule, with which one foresees some persons
will divert themselves, upon finding lesser pains considered as
instances of divine punishment. There is no possibility of
answering or evading the general thing here intended, without
denying all final causes. For final causes being admitted, the
pleasures and pains now mentioned must be admitted too as instances
of them. And if they are; if God annexes delight to
some actions, and uneasiness to others, with an apparent design
to induce us to act so and so; then he not only dispenses happiness
and misery, but also rewards and punishes actions. If, for
example, the pain which we feel, upon doing what tends to the
destruction of our bodies, suppose upon too near approaches to
fire, or upon wounding ourselves, be appointed by the Author of
nature to prevent our doing what thus tends to our destruction;
this is altogether as much an instance of his punishing our
actions, and consequently of our being under his government,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as
declaring by a voice from heaven, that if we acted so, he would
inflict such pain upon us; and inflicting it, whether it be greater
or less.</p>

<p>Thus we find, that the true notion or conception of the Author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of nature, is that of a master or governor, prior to the consideration
of his moral attributes. The fact of our case, which we
find by experience, is, that he actually exercises dominion or
government over us at present, by rewarding and punishing us
for our actions, in as strict and proper a sense of these words,
and even in the same sense, as children, servants, subjects, are
rewarded and punished by those who govern them.</p>

<p>Thus the whole analogy of nature, the whole present course
of things, most fully shows, that there is nothing incredible in
the general doctrine of religion, that God will reward and punish
men for their actions hereafter: nothing incredible, I mean,
arising out of the notion of rewarding and punishing. For the
whole course of nature is a present instance of his exercising that
government over us, which implies in it rewarding and punishing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As divine <em>punishment</em> is what men chiefly object against, and
are most unwilling to allow; it may be proper to mention some
circumstances in the natural course of punishments at present,
which are analogous to what religion teaches us concerning a
future state of punishment; indeed so analogous, that as they
add a further credibility to it, so they cannot but raise a most
serious apprehension of it in those who will attend to them.</p>

<p>It has been now observed, that such and such miseries naturally
follow such and such actions of imprudence and wilfulness,
as well as actions more commonly and more distinctly considered
as vicious; and that these consequences, when they may be foreseen,
are properly natural punishments annexed to such actions.
The general thing here insisted upon, is, not that we see a great
deal of misery in the world, but a great deal which men bring
upon themselves by their own behavior, which they might have
foreseen and avoided. Now the circumstances of these natural
punishments, particularly deserving our attention, are such as
these. Oftentimes they follow, or are inflicted in consequence
of, actions which procure many present advantages, and are accompanied
with much present pleasure; for instance, sickness
and untimely death are the consequence of intemperance, though
accompanied with the highest mirth, and jollity. These punishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are often much greater, than the advantages or pleasures
obtained by the actions, of which they are the punishments or
consequences. Though we may imagine a constitution of nature,
in which these natural punishments, which are in fact to follow,
would follow, immediately upon such actions being done, or very
soon after; we find on the contrary in our world, that they are
often delayed a great while, sometimes even till long after the
actions occasioning them are forgot; so that the constitution of
nature is such, that delay of punishment is no sort nor degree
of presumption of final impunity. After such delay, these
natural punishments or miseries often come, not by degrees, but
suddenly, with violence, and at once; however, the chief misery
often does. As certainty of such distant misery following such
actions, is never afforded persons, so perhaps during the actions,
they have seldom a distinct, full expectation of its following:<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and many times the case is only thus, that they see in general, or
may see, the credibility, that intemperance, suppose, will bring
after it diseases; civil crimes, civil punishments; when yet the
real probability often is, that they shall escape; but things notwithstanding
take their destined course, and the misery inevitably
follows at its appointed time, in very many of these cases.
Thus also though youth may be alleged as an excuse for rashness
and folly, as being naturally thoughtless, and not clearly foreseeing
all the consequences of being untractable and profligate, this
does not hinder, but that these consequences follow; and are
grievously felt, throughout the whole course of mature life.
Habits contracted even in that age, are often utter ruin: and
men’s success in the world, not only in the common sense of
worldly success, but their real happiness and misery, depends, in
a great degree, and in various ways, upon the manner in which
they pass their youth; which consequences they for the most
part neglect to consider, and perhaps seldom can properly be said
to believe, beforehand. In numberless cases, the natural course
of things affords us opportunities for procuring advantages to
ourselves at certain times, which we cannot procure when we
will; nor ever recall the opportunities, if we have neglected
them. Indeed the general course of nature is an example of
this. If, during the opportunity of youth, persons are indocile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and self-willed, they inevitably suffer in their future life, for
want of those acquirements, which they neglected the natural
season of attaining. If the husbandman lets seedtime pass
without sowing, the whole year is lost to him beyond recovery.
Though after men have been guilty of folly and extravagance <em>up
to a certain degree</em>, it is often in their power, to retrieve their
affairs, to recover their health and character, at least in good
measure; yet real reformation is in many cases, of no avail at all
towards preventing the miseries, poverty, sickness, infamy, naturally
annexed to folly and extravagance <em>exceeding that degree</em>.
There is a certain bound to imprudence and misbehavior, which
being transgressed, there remains no place for repentance in the
natural course of things. It is further very much to be remarked,
that neglects from inconsiderateness, want of attention,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
not looking about us to see what we have to do, are often attended
with consequences altogether as dreadful, as any active
misbehavior, from the most extravagant passion. And lastly,
civil government being natural, the punishments of it are so too:
and some of these punishments are capital; as the effects of a
dissolute course of pleasure are often mortal. So that many
natural punishments are final<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to him who incurs them, if considered
only in his temporal capacity; and seem inflicted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
natural appointment, either to remove the offender out of the
way of being further mischievous, or as an example, though frequently
a disregarded one, to those who are left behind.</p>

<p>These things are not what we call accidental, or to be met with
only now and then; but they are things of every day’s experience.
They proceed from general laws, very general ones, by
which God governs the world in the natural course of his
providence.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>And they are so analogous, to what religion teaches us concerning
the future punishment of the wicked, so much of a piece
with it, that both would naturally be expressed in the very same
words, and manner of description. In the book of <cite>Proverbs</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> for
instance, wisdom is introduced, as frequenting the most public
places of resort, and as rejected when she offers herself as the
natural appointed guide of human life. <em>How long</em>, speaking to
those who are passing through it, <cite>how long, ye simple ones, will
ye love folly, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools
hate knowledge? Turn ye at my reproof. Behold, I will pour
out my spirit upon you, I will make known my words unto you.</cite>
But upon being neglected, <cite>Because I have called, and ye refused,
I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye
have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when
your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and
your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and
anguish come upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I
will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find
me.</cite> This passage, every one sees, is poetical, and some parts of
it are highly figurative; but the meaning is obvious. And the
thing intended is expressed more literally in the following words;
<em>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
the Lord&mdash;&mdash;therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own
way, and be filled with their own devices. For the security of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy
them.</em> The whole passage is so equally applicable to what
we experience in the present world, concerning the consequences
of men’s actions, and to what religion teaches us is to be expected
in another, that it may be questioned which of the two was principally
intended.</p>

<p>Indeed when one has been recollecting the proper proofs of a
future state of rewards and punishments, nothing methinks can
give one so sensible an apprehension of the latter, or representation
of it to the mind, as observing, that after the many disregarded
checks, admonitions, and warnings, which people meet
with in the ways of vice and folly and extravagance, warnings
from their very nature, from the examples of others, from the
lesser inconveniences which they bring upon themselves, from
the instructions of wise and virtuous men: after these have been
long despised, scorned, ridiculed: after the chief bad consequences,
temporal consequences, of their follies, have been delayed
for a great while, at length they break in irresistibly, like
an armed force: repentance is too late to relieve, and can serve
only to aggravate their distress, the case is become desperate:
and poverty and sickness, remorse and anguish, infamy and
death, the effects of their own doings, overwhelm them beyond
possibility of remedy or escape. This is an account of what is;
in fact, the general constitution of nature.</p>

<p>It is not in any sort meant, that, according to what appears at
present of the natural course of things, men are always uniformly
punished in proportion to their misbehavior. But that there are
very many instances of misbehavior punished in the several ways
now mentioned, and very dreadful instances too; sufficient to
show what the laws of the universe may admit, and, if thoroughly
considered, sufficient fully to answer all objections against the
credibility of a future state of punishments, from any imaginations,
that the frailty of our nature and external temptations,
almost annihilate the guilt of human vices: as well as objections
of another sort; from necessity, from suppositions, that the will
of an infinite Being cannot be contradicted, or that he must be
incapable of offence and provocation.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Reflections of this kind are not without their terrors to serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
persons, even the most free from enthusiasm, and of the greatest
strength of mind; but it is fit that things be stated and considered
as they really are. There is, in the present age, a certain
fearlessness with regard to what may be hereafter under the
government of God, which nothing but a universally acknowledged
demonstration on the side of atheism can justify; and
which makes it quite necessary, that men be reminded, and if
possible made to feel, that there is no sort of ground for being
thus presumptuous, even upon the most sceptical principles. For,
may it not be said of any person upon his being born into the
world, he may behave so as to be of no service to it, but by
being made an example of the woeful effects of vice and folly?
That he may, as any one may, if he will, incur an infamous
execution from the hands of civil justice, or in some other
course of extravagance shorten his days; or bring upon himself
infamy and diseases worse than death? So that it had been
better for him, even with regard to the present world, that he
had never been born. And is there any pretence of reason for
people to think themselves secure, and talk as if they had certain
proof, that, let them act as licentiously as they will, there can be
nothing analogous to this, with regard to a future and more general
interest, under the providence and government of the same
God?</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD.</span></h3>

<p>As the manifold appearances of design, and of final causes, in
the constitution of the world, prove it to be the work of an intelligent
mind, so the particular final causes of pleasure and pain
distributed amongst his creatures, prove that they are under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
government; what may be called his natural government of
creatures endued with sense and reason. This implies somewhat
more than seems usually attended to, when we speak of God’s
natural government of the world. It implies government of
the very same kind with that which a master exercises over
his servants, or a civil magistrate over his subjects. These latter
instances of final causes, as really prove an intelligent <em>Governor</em>
of the world, in the sense now mentioned, and before<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> distinctly
treated of; as any other instances of final causes prove an intelligent
<em>Maker</em> of it.</p>

<p>But this alone does not appear at first sight to determine any
thing certainly, concerning the moral character of the Author of
nature, considered in this relation of governor; does not ascertain
his government to be moral, or prove that he is the righteous
Judge of the world. Moral government consists, not in barely
rewarding and punishing men for their actions, which the most
tyrannical may do, but in rewarding the righteous, and punishing
the wicked: in rendering to men according to their actions,
considered as good or evil. And the <em>perfection</em> of moral government
consists in doing this, with regard to all intelligent creatures,
in an exact proportion to their personal merits or demerits.</p>

<p>Some men seem to think the only character of the Author of
nature to be that of simple absolute benevolence. This, considered
as a principle of action and infinite in degree, is a disposition
to produce the greatest possible happiness, without regard
to persons’ behavior, otherwise than as such regard would produce
higher degrees of it. And supposing this to be the only
character of God, veracity and justice in him would be nothing
but benevolence conducted by wisdom. Surely this ought not to
be asserted, unless it can be proved; for we should speak with
cautious reverence upon such a subject. Whether it can be
proved or no, is not the thing here to be inquired into; but
whether in the constitution and conduct of the world, a righteous
government be not discernibly planned out: which necessarily
implies a righteous governor. There may possibly be in the
creation beings, to whom the Author of nature manifests himself
under this most amiable of all characters, this of infinite absolute
benevolence; for it is the most amiable, supposing it not, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
perhaps it is not, incompatible with justice; but he manifests
himself to us under the character of a righteous governor. He
may, consistently with this, be simply and absolutely benevolent,
in the sense now explained: but he is (for he has given us a
proof in the constitution and conduct of the world that he is) a
governor over servants, as he rewards and punishes us for our
actions. And in the constitution and conduct of it, he may also
have given, besides the reason of the thing, and the natural presages
of conscience, clear and distinct intimations, that his government
is righteous or moral: clear to such as think the nature of
it deserving their attention, and yet not to every careless person,
who casts a transient reflection upon the subject.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It is particularly to be observed, that the divine government,
which we experience ourselves under in the present state, taken
alone, is allowed not to be the perfection of moral government.
Yet this by no means hinders, but that there may be <em>somewhat</em>,
be it more or less, truly moral in it. A righteous government
may plainly appear to be carried on to some degree, enough to
give us the apprehension that it shall be completed, or carried on
to that degree of perfection which religion teaches us it shall;
but which cannot appear, till much more of the divine administration
be seen, than can be seen in the present life. The design
of this chapter is to inquire how far this is the case: how far,
over and above the moral nature<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> which God has given us, and
our natural notion of him as righteous governor of those his
creatures, to whom he has given this nature;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> I say how far besides
this, the principles and beginnings of a moral government
over the world may be discerned, notwithstanding and amidst all
the confusion and disorder of it.</p>

<p>One might mention here, what has been often urged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
great force, that, in general, less uneasiness and more satisfaction,
are the natural consequences<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> of a virtuous than of a vicious
course of life, in the present state, as an instance of a moral
government established in nature; an instance of it collected
from experience and present matter of fact.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But it must be
owned a thing of difficulty to weigh and balance pleasures and uneasinesses,
each amongst themselves, and also against each other,
so as to make an estimate with any exactness, of the overplus of
happiness on the side of virtue. And it is not impossible, that,
amidst the infinite disorders of the world, there may be exceptions
to the happiness of virtue; even with regard to persons,
whose course of life from their youth up has been blameless: and
more with regard to those who have gone on for some time in the
ways of vice, and have afterwards reformed. For suppose an instance
of the latter case; a person with his passions inflamed,
his natural faculty of self-government impaired by habits of indulgence,
and with all his vices about him, like so many harpies,
craving their accustomed gratification; who can say how long it
might be, before such a person would find more satisfaction in
the reasonableness and present good consequences of virtue, than
difficulties and self-denial in the restraints of it? Experience
also shows, that men can to a great degree, get over their sense
of shame, so as that by professing themselves to be without principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and avowing even direct villany, they can support themselves
against the infamy of it. But as the ill actions of any
one will probably be more talked of, and oftener thrown in his
way, upon his reformation; so the infamy of them will be much
more felt, after the natural sense of virtue and of honor is recovered.
Uneasiness of this kind ought indeed to be put to the
account of former vices: yet it will be said they are in part the
consequences of reformation. Still I am far from allowing it
doubtful, whether virtue, upon the whole, be happier than vice
in the present world. If it were, yet the beginnings of a
righteous administration may, beyond all question, be found in
nature, if we will attentively inquire after them.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>I. In whatever manner the notion of God’s moral government
over the world might be treated, if it did not appear, whether he
were in a proper sense our governor at all; yet when it is certain
matter of experience, that he does manifest himself to us under
the character of a governor in the sense explained,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> it must
deserve to be considered, whether there be not reason to apprehend,
that he may be a righteous or moral governor. Since it
appears to be fact, that God does govern mankind by the method
of rewards and punishments, according to some settled rules of
distribution; it is surely a question to be asked, what presumption
is there against his <em>finally</em> rewarding and punishing them
according to this particular rule, namely, as they act reasonably,
or unreasonably, virtuously or viciously? Rendering men happy
or miserable by this rule, certainly falls in, much more falls in,
with our natural apprehensions and sense of things, than doing
so by any other rule whatever; since rewarding and punishing
actions by any other rule, would appear much harder to be accounted
for, by minds formed as he has formed ours. Be the
evidence of religion then more or less clear, the expectation
which it raises in us, that the righteous shall, upon the whole,
be happy, and the wicked miserable, cannot possibly be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as absurd or chimerical; because it is no more than an
expectation, that a method of government already begun, shall
be carried on, the method of rewarding and punishing actions;
and shall be carried on by a particular rule, which unavoidably
appears to us at first sight more natural than any other, the rule
which we call distributive justice. Nor,</p>

<p>II. Ought it to be entirely passed over, that tranquillity, satisfaction,
and external advantages, being the natural consequences
of prudent management of ourselves, and our affairs; and rashness,
profligate negligence, and wilful folly, bringing after them
many inconveniences and sufferings; these afford instances of a
right constitution of nature, as the correction of children, for
their own sakes, and by way of example, when they run into
danger or hurt themselves, is a part of right education.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Thus,
that God governs the world by general fixed laws, that he has
endued us with capacities of reflecting upon this constitution of
things, and foreseeing the good and bad consequences of behavior,
plainly implies <em>some sort</em> of moral government; since from such
a constitution of things it cannot but follow, that prudence and
imprudence, which are of the nature of virtue and vice,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> must
be, as they are, respectively rewarded and punished.</p>

<p>III. From the natural course of things, vicious actions are, to
a great degree, actually punished as mischievous to society; and
besides punishment actually inflicted upon this account, there is
also the fear and apprehension of it in those persons, whose
crimes have rendered them obnoxious to it, in case of a discovery;
this state of fear being often itself a very considerable punishment.
The natural fear and apprehension of it too, which restrains
from such crimes, is a declaration of nature against them.
It is necessary to the very being of society, that vices, destructive
of it, should be punished <em>as being so</em>; the vices of falsehood,
injustice, cruelty: which punishment therefore is as natural as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
society, and so is an instance of a kind of moral government,
naturally established, and actually taking place. And, since the
certain natural course of things is the conduct of providence or
the government of God, though carried on by the instrumentality
of men, the observation here made amounts to this, that mankind
find themselves placed by him in such circumstances, as that they
are unavoidably accountable for their behavior; and are often
punished, and sometimes rewarded, under his government, in
the view of their being mischievous, or eminently beneficial to
society.</p>

<p>If it be objected that good actions and such as are beneficial
to society, are often punished, as in the case of persecution and
in other cases; and that ill and mischievous actions are often
rewarded:<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> it may be answered distinctly, first, that this is in no
sort necessary, and consequently not natural in the sense in
which it is necessary, and therefore natural, that ill or mischievous
actions should be punished: and in the next place, that
good actions are never punished, considered as beneficial to
society, nor ill actions rewarded, under the view of their being
hurtful to it. So that it stands good, without any thing on the
side of vice to be set over against it, that the Author of nature
has as truly directed, that vicious actions, considered as mischievous
to society, should be punished, and put mankind under
a <em>necessity</em> of thus punishing them, as he has directed and necessitated
us to preserve our lives by food.</p>

<p>IV. In the natural course of things, virtue <em>as such</em> is actually
rewarded, and vice <em>as such</em> punished: which seems to afford an
instance or example, not only of government, but of moral
government, begun and established; moral in the strictest sense,
though not in that perfection of degree, which religion teaches
us to expect. In order to see this more clearly, we must distinguish
between <em>actions</em> themselves, and that <em>quality</em> ascribed to
them, which we call virtuous or vicious.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The gratification itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of every natural passion, must be attended with delight; and
acquisitions of fortune, however made, are acquisitions of the
means or materials of enjoyment. An action then, by which
any natural passion is gratified, or fortune acquired, procures
delight or advantage; abstracted from all consideration of the
morality of such action. Consequently, the pleasure or advantage
in this case, is gained by the action itself, not by the
morality, the virtuousness or viciousness of it; though it be perhaps
virtuous or vicious.</p>

<p>To say that such an action or course of behavior, procured
such pleasure or advantage, or brought on such inconvenience
and pain, is quite a different thing from saying, that such good
or bad effect was owing to the virtue or vice of such action or
behavior. In one case, an action abstracted from all moral consideration,
produced its effect: in the other case, for it will appear
that there are such cases, the morality of the action under
a moral consideration, <i>i.e.</i> the virtuousness or viciousness of it,
produced the effect. Now I say virtue as such, naturally procures
considerable advantages to the virtuous, and vice as such,
naturally occasions great inconvenience and even misery to the
vicious, in very many instances. The immediate effects of virtue
and vice upon the mind and temper, are to be mentioned as instances
of it. Vice as such is naturally attended with some sort
of uneasiness, and not uncommonly, with great disturbance and
apprehension. That inward feeling, which, respecting lesser
matters and in familiar speech we call being vexed with oneself,
and in matters of importance and in more serious language, remorse;
is an uneasiness naturally arising from an action of a
man’s own, reflected upon by himself as wrong, unreasonable,
faulty, <i>i.e.</i> vicious in greater or less degrees: and this manifestly
is a different feeling from that uneasiness, which arises from a
sense of mere loss or harm. What is more common, than to
hear a man lamenting an accident or event, and adding&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
however he has the satisfaction that he cannot blame himself for
it; or on the contrary, that he has the uneasiness of being sensible
it was his own doing? Thus also the disturbance and fear,
which often follow upon a man’s having done an injury, arise
from a sense of his being blameworthy; otherwise there would,
in many cases, be no ground of disturbance, nor any reason to
fear resentment or shame. On the other hand, inward security
and peace, and a mind open to the several gratifications of life,
are the natural attendants of innocence and virtue. To which
must be added the complacency, satisfaction, and even joy of
heart, which accompany the exercise, the real exercise of gratitude,
friendship, benevolence.</p>

<p>And here, I think, ought to be mentioned the fears of future
punishment, and peaceful hopes of a better life, in those who
fully believe, or have any serious apprehension of religion: because
these hopes and fears are present uneasiness and satisfaction
to the mind, and cannot be got rid of by great part of the
world, even by men who have thought most thoroughly upon the
subject of religion. And no one can say, how considerable this
uneasiness or satisfaction may be, or what upon the whole it may
amount to.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>In the next place comes in the consideration, that all honest
and good men are disposed to befriend honest good men as such,
and to discountenance the vicious as such, and do so in some
degree; indeed in a considerable degree: from which favor and
discouragement cannot but arise considerable advantage and inconvenience.
Though the generality of the world have little
regard to the morality of their own actions, and may be supposed
to have less to that of others, when they themselves are not concerned;
yet let any one be known to be a man of virtue, somehow
or other he will be favored and good offices will be done him,
from regard to his character, without remote views, occasionally,
and in some low degree, I think, by the generality of the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as it happens to come in their way. Public honors too and advantages
are the natural consequences, and sometimes at least,
the consequences in fact, of virtuous actions; of eminent justice,
fidelity, charity, love to our country, considered in the view of
being virtuous. And sometimes even death itself, often infamy
and external inconveniences, are the public consequences of vice
as vice. For instance, the sense which mankind have of tyranny,
injustice, oppression, additional to the mere feeling or fear of
misery, has doubtless been instrumental in bringing about revolutions,
which make a figure even in the history of the world.
For it is plain, that men resent injuries as implying faultiness,
and retaliate, not merely under the notion of having received
harm, but of having received wrong; and they have this resentment
in behalf of others, as well as of themselves. So likewise
even the generality are, in some degree, grateful and disposed to
return good offices, not merely because such a one has been the
occasion of good to them, but under the view, that such good
offices implied kind intention and good desert in the doer.</p>

<p>To all this may be added two or three particular things, which
many persons will think frivolous; but to me nothing appears so,
which at all comes in towards determining a question of such importance,
as, whether there be or be not, a moral institution of
government, in the strictest sense moral, <em>visibly</em> established and
begun in nature. The particular things are these: That in
domestic government, which is doubtless natural, children and
others also are very generally punished for falsehood, injustice,
and ill-behavior, as such, and rewarded for the contrary: which
are instances of veracity and justice and right behavior, as such,
naturally enforced by rewards and punishments, more or less considerable.
That, though civil government be supposed to take
cognizance of actions in no other view than as prejudicial to
society, without respect to the immorality of them, yet as such
actions are immoral, so the sense which men have of the immorality
of them, very greatly contributes, in different ways, to
bring offenders to justice. And that entire absence of all crime
and guilt in the moral sense, when plainly appearing, will almost
of course procure, and circumstances of aggravated guilt prevent,
a remission of the penalties annexed to civil crimes, in many
cases, though by no means in all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the whole then, besides the good and bad effects of
virtue and vice upon men’s own minds, the course of the world
does, in some measure, turn upon the approbation and disapprobation
of them as such, in others. The sense of well and ill
doing, the presages of conscience, the love of good characters
and dislike of bad ones, honor, shame, resentment, gratitude, all
these, considered in themselves, and in their effects, do afford
manifest real instances, of virtue as such naturally favored, and
of vice as such discountenanced, more or less, in the daily course
of human life; in every age, in every relation, in every general
circumstance of it. That God has given us a moral nature,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> may
most justly be urged as a proof of our being under his moral
government: but that he has placed us in a condition, which
gives this nature, as one may speak, scope to operate, and in
which it does unavoidably operate; <i>i.e.</i> influence mankind to act,
so as thus to favor and reward virtue, and discountenance and
punish vice, this is not the same, but a further additional proof
of his moral government; for it is an instance of it. The first
is a proof, that he will finally favor and support virtue effectually:
the second is an example of his favoring and supporting it at
present, in some degree.</p>

<p>If a more distinct inquiry be made, whence it arises, that
virtue as such is often rewarded, and vice as such is punished,
and this rule never inverted, it will be found to proceed, in part,
immediately from the moral nature itself, which God has given
us;<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and also in part, from his having given us, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
this nature, so great a power over each other’s happiness and
misery. For, <i>first</i>, it is certain, that peace and delight, in some
degree and upon some occasions, is the necessary and present
effect of virtuous practice; an effect arising immediately from
that constitution of our nature. We are <em>so made</em>, that well-doing
as such, gives us satisfaction, at least in some instances; ill-doing
as such, in none. And, <i>secondly</i>, from our moral nature, joined
with God’s having put our happiness and misery in many respects
in each other’s power, it cannot but be, that vice as such, some
kinds and instances of it at least, will be infamous, and men will
be disposed to punish it as in itself detestable; and the villain
will by no means be able always to avoid feeling that infamy, any
more than he will be able to escape this further punishment,
which mankind will be disposed to inflict upon him, under the
notion of his deserving it. But there can be nothing on the side
of vice, to answer this; because there is nothing in the human
mind contradictory, as the logicians speak, to virtue. For virtue
consists in a regard to what is right and reasonable, as being so;
in a regard to veracity, justice, charity, in themselves: and there
is surely no such thing, as a like natural regard to falsehood,
injustice, cruelty. If it be thought, that there are instances of
an approbation of vice, as such, in itself, and for its own sake,
(though it does not appear to me, that there is any such thing at
all;) it is evidently monstrous: as much so, as the most acknowledged
perversion of any passion whatever. Such instances of
perversion then being left out, as merely imaginary, or at least
unnatural; it must follow, from the frame of our nature, and
from our condition, in the respects now described, that vice cannot
at all be, and virtue cannot but be, favored as such by others,
upon some occasions, and happy in itself, in some degree. For
what is here insisted upon, is not the <em>degree</em> in which virtue and
vice are thus distinguished, but only the thing itself, that they
are so in some degree; though the whole good and bad effect of
virtue and vice as such, is not inconsiderable in degree. But
that they must be thus distinguished in some degree, is in a
manner necessary: it is matter of fact of daily experience, even
in the greatest confusion of human affairs.</p>

<p>It is not pretended but that, in the natural course of things,
happiness and misery appear to be distributed by other rules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
than only the personal merit and demerit of characters. They
may sometimes be distributed by way of mere discipline. There
may be the wisest and best reasons, why the world should be
governed by general laws, from whence such promiscuous distribution
perhaps must follow; and also why our happiness and
misery should be put in each other’s power, in the degree which
they are. And these things, as, in general, they contribute to
the rewarding virtue and punishing vice, as such, so they often
contribute also, not to the inversion of this, which is impossible,
but to the rendering persons prosperous, though wicked; afflicted,
though righteous; and, which is worse, to the <em>rewarding some
actions</em>, though vicious, and <em>punishing other actions</em>, though
virtuous.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But all this cannot drown the voice of nature in the
conduct of Providence, plainly declaring itself for virtue, by way
of distinction from vice, and preference to it. For our being so
constituted as that virtue and vice are thus naturally favored and
discountenanced, rewarded and punished, respectively as such, is
an intuitive proof of the intent of nature, that it should be so;
otherwise the constitution of our mind, from which it thus immediately
and directly proceeds, would be absurd. But it cannot
be said, because virtuous actions are sometimes punished, and
vicious actions rewarded, that nature intended it. For, though
this great disorder is brought about, as all actions are, by means
of some natural passion; yet <em>this may be</em>, as it undoubtedly is,
brought about by the perversion of such passion, implanted in us
for other, and those very good purposes. And indeed these other
and good purposes, even of every passion, may be clearly seen.</p>

<p>We have then a declaration, in some degree of present effect,
from Him who is supreme in nature, which side he is of, or
what part he takes; a declaration for virtue, and against vice.
So far therefore as a man is true to virtue, to veracity and justice,
to equity and charity, and the right of the case, in whatever he
is concerned; so far he is on the side of the divine administration,
and co-operates with it: and from hence, to such a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
arises naturally a secret satisfaction and sense of security, and
implicit hope of somewhat further.</p>

<p>V. This hope is confirmed by the necessary tendencies of
virtue, which, though not of present effect, yet are at present
discernible in nature; and so afford an instance of somewhat
moral in the essential constitution of it. There is, in the nature
of things, a tendency in virtue and vice to produce the good and
bad effects now mentioned, in a greater degree than they do in
fact produce them. For instance; good and bad men would be
much more rewarded and punished as such, were it not, that
justice is often artificially eluded,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that characters are not known,
and many, who would thus favor virtue and discourage vice, are
hindered from doing so, by accidental causes. These tendencies
of virtue and vice are obvious with regard to <em>individuals</em>. But
it may require more particularly to be considered, that power in
a <em>society</em>, by being under the direction of virtue, naturally increases,
and has a necessary tendency to prevail over opposite
power, not under the direction of it; in like manner, as power,
by being under the direction of reason, increases, and has a
tendency to prevail over brute force. There are several brute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
creatures of equal, and several of superior strength, to that of
men; and possibly the sum of the whole strength of brutes may
be greater than that of mankind; but reason gives us the advantage
and superiority over them; and thus man is the acknowledged
governing animal upon the earth. Nor is this superiority
considered by any as accidental; but as what reason has a tendency,
in the nature of the thing, to obtain. And yet perhaps
difficulties may be raised about the meaning, as well as the truth,
of the assertion, that virtue has the like tendency.</p>

<p>To obviate these difficulties, let us see more distinctly, how the
case stands with regard to reason; which is so readily acknowledged
to have this advantageous tendency. Suppose then two or
three men, of the best and most improved understanding, in a desolate
open plain, attacked by ten times the number of beasts of
prey: would their reason secure them the victory in this unequal
combat? Power then, though joined with reason, and under its
direction, cannot be expected to prevail over opposite power,
though merely brutal, unless the one bears some proportion to
the other. Again: put the imaginary case, that rational and
irrational creatures were of like external shape and manner: it
is certain, before there were opportunities for the first to distinguish
each other, to separate from their adversaries, and to form
a union among themselves, they might be upon a level, or in
several respects upon great disadvantage; though united they
might be vastly superior: since union is of such efficacy, that
ten men united, might be able to accomplish, what ten thousand
of the same natural strength and understanding wholly ununited,
could not. In this case, brute force might more than maintain
its ground against reason, for want of union among the rational
creatures. Or suppose a number of men to land upon an island
inhabited only by wild beasts; men who, by the regulations of
civil government, the inventions of art, and the experience of
some years, could they be preserved so long, would be really sufficient
to subdue the wild beasts, and to preserve themselves in
security from them: yet a conjuncture of accidents might give
such advantage to the irrational animals as they might at once
overpower, and even extirpate, the rational ones. Length of
time then, proper scope, and opportunities for reason to exert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
itself, may be absolutely necessary to its prevailing over brute
force.</p>

<p>Further: there are many instances of brutes succeeding in
attempts, which they could not have undertaken, had not their
irrational nature rendered them incapable of foreseeing the danger
of such attempt, or the fury of passion hindered their attending
to it: and there are instances of reason and real prudence preventing
men’s undertaking what, it has appeared afterwards,
they might have succeeded in by a lucky rashness. In certain
conjunctures, ignorance and folly, weakness and discord, may have
their advantages. So that rational animals have not <em>necessarily</em>
the superiority over irrational ones; but, how improbable soever
it may be, it is evidently possible, that in some globes the latter
may be superior. And were the former wholly at variance and disunited,
by false self-interest and envy, by treachery and injustice,
and consequent rage and malice against each other, whilst the
latter were firmly united among themselves by instinct, this might
greatly contribute to the introducing such an inverted order of
things. For every one would consider it as inverted: since
reason has, in the nature of it, a tendency to prevail over brute
force; notwithstanding the possibility it may not prevail, and the
necessity, which there is, of many concurring circumstances to
render it prevalent.</p>

<p>Now I say, virtue in a society has a like tendency to procure
superiority and additional power: whether this power be considered
as the means of security from opposite power, or of obtaining
other advantages. It has this tendency, by rendering
public good, an object and end, to every member of the society;
by putting every one upon consideration and diligence, recollection
and self-government, both in order to see what is the most
effectual method, and also in order to perform their proper part,
for obtaining and preserving it; by uniting a society within itself,
and so increasing its strength; and, which is particularly to be
mentioned, uniting it by means of veracity and justice. For as
these last are principal bonds of union, so benevolence or public
spirit, undirected, unrestrained by them, is, nobody knows what.</p>

<p>And suppose the invisible world, and the invisible dispensations
of Providence, to be, in any sort, analogous to what appears:
or that both together make up one uniform scheme, the two parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of which, the part which we see, and that which is beyond our
observation, are analogous to each other: then, there must be a
like natural tendency in the derived power, throughout the universe,
under the direction of virtue, to prevail in general over
that which is not under its direction; as there is in reason,
derived reason in the universe, to prevail over brute force.</p>

<p>But then, in order to the prevalence of virtue, or that it may
actually produce, what it has a tendency to produce; the <em>like
concurrences are necessary</em>, as are, to the prevalence of reason.
There must be some proportion, between the natural power or
force which is, and that which is not, under the direction of
virtue: there must be sufficient length of time; for the complete
success of virtue, as of reason, cannot, from the nature of the
thing, be otherwise than gradual: there must be, as one may
speak, a fair field of trial, a stage large and extensive enough,
proper occasions and opportunities, for the virtuous to join together,
to exert themselves against lawless force, and to reap the
fruit of their united labors. Now indeed it is to be hoped, that
the disproportion between the good and bad, even here on earth,
is not so great, but that the former have natural power sufficient
to their prevailing to a considerable degree, if circumstances
would permit this power to be united. For, much less, very
much less, power under the direction of virtue, would prevail
over much greater not under the direction of it.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> However,
good men over the face of the earth cannot unite; because,
(among other reasons,) they cannot be sufficiently ascertained of
each other’s characters. And the known course of human things,
the scene we are now passing through, particularly the shortness
of life, denies to virtue its full scope in several other respects.</p>

<p>The natural tendency which we have been considering, though
real, is <em>hindered</em> from being carried into effect in the present
state: but these hinderances may be removed in a future one.
Virtue, to borrow the Christian allusion, is militant here; and
various untoward accidents contribute to its being often overborne:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
but it may combat with greater advantage hereafter, and
prevail completely, and enjoy its consequent rewards, in some
future states. Neglected as it is, perhaps unknown, perhaps
despised and oppressed here; there maybe scenes in eternity,
lasting enough, and in every other way adapted, to afford it a
sufficient sphere of action; and a sufficient sphere for the natural
consequences of it to follow in fact. If the soul be naturally
immortal, and this state be a progress towards a future one, as
childhood is towards mature age, good men may naturally unite,
not only among themselves, but also with other orders of virtuous
creatures, in that future state. For virtue, from the very
nature of it, is a principle and bond of union, in some degree,
among all who are endued with it, and known to each other; so
as that by it, a good man cannot but recommend himself to the
favor and protection of all virtuous beings, throughout the whole
universe, who can be acquainted with his character, and can
any way interpose in his behalf in any part of his duration.</p>

<p>One might add, that suppose all this advantageous tendency of
virtue to become effect, among one or more orders of creatures,
in any distant scenes and periods, and to be seen by any orders
of vicious creatures, throughout the universal kingdom of God;
this happy effect of virtue would have a tendency, by way of example,
and possibly in other ways, to amend those of them who
are capable of amendment, and of being recovered to a just sense
of virtue. If our notions of the plan of Providence were
enlarged in any sort proportionable to what late discoveries have
enlarged our views with respect to the material world, representations
of this kind would not appear absurd or extravagant. They
are not to be taken as intended for a literal delineation of what
is in fact the particular scheme of the universe, which cannot be
known without revelation: for suppositions are not to be looked
on as true, because not incredible: but they are mentioned to
show, that our finding virtue to be hindered from procuring to
itself such superiority and advantages, is no objection against its
having, in the essential nature of the thing, a tendency to procure
them. And the suppositions now mentioned do plainly show
this: for they show, that these hinderances are so far from being
necessary, that we ourselves can easily conceive, how they may
be removed in future states, and full scope be granted to virtue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
And all these advantageous tendencies of it are to be considered
as declarations of God in its favor. This however is taking a
pretty large compass: though it is certain, that, as the material
world appears to be, in a manner, boundless and immense, there
must be <em>some</em> scheme of Providence vast in proportion to it.</p>

<p>But let us return to the earth our habitation; and we shall see
this happy tendency of virtue, by imagining an instance not so
vast and remote: by supposing a kingdom or society of men upon
it, perfectly virtuous, for a succession of many ages; to which,
if you please, may be given a situation advantageous for universal
monarchy. In such a state, there would be no such thing as
faction: but men of the greatest capacity would of course, all
along, have the chief direction of affairs willingly yielded to
them; and they would share it among themselves without envy.
Each of these would have the part assigned him, to which his
genius was peculiarly adapted; and others, who had not any distinguished
genius, would be safe, and think themselves very
happy, by being under the protection and guidance of those who
had. Public determinations would really be the result of the
united wisdom of the community: and they would faithfully be
executed, by the united strength of it. Some would contribute
in a higher way, but all in some way, to the public prosperity:
and in it, each would enjoy the fruits of his own virtue. And
as injustice, whether by fraud or force, would be unknown among
themselves, so they would be sufficiently secured from it in their
neighbors. For cunning and false self-interest, confederacies in
injustice, ever slight, and accompanied with faction and intestine
treachery; these on one hand would be found mere childish folly
and weakness, when set in opposition against wisdom, public
spirit, union inviolable, and fidelity on the other: allowing both
a sufficient length of years to try their force. Add the general
influence, which such a kingdom would have over the face of the
earth, by way of example particularly, and the reverence which
would be paid it. It would plainly be superior to all others, and
the world must gradually come under its empire; not by means
of lawless violence; but partly by what must be allowed to be just
conquest; and partly by other kingdoms submitting themselves
voluntarily to it, throughout a course of ages, and claiming its
protection, one after another, in successive exigencies. The head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of it would be a universal monarch, in another sense than any
mortal has yet been; and the Eastern style would be literally
applicable to him, <em>that all people, nations, and languages should
serve him</em>. And though indeed our knowledge of human nature,
and the whole history of mankind, show the impossibility, without
some miraculous interposition, that a number of men, here
on earth, should unite in one society or government, in the fear
of God and universal practice of virtue; and that such a government
should continue so united for a succession of ages: yet admitting
or supposing this, the effect would be as now drawn out.
Thus for instance, the wonderful power and prosperity promised
to the Jewish nation in the Scripture, would be, in a great measure,
the consequence of what is predicted of them; that the
<em>people should be all righteous, and inherit the land forever</em>;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
were we to understand the latter phrase of a long continuance only,
sufficient to give things time to work. The predictions of this
kind, for there are many of them, cannot come to pass, in the
present known course of nature; but suppose them come to pass,
and then, the dominion and preëminence promised must naturally
follow, to a very considerable degree.</p>

<p>Consider now the general system of religion; that the government
of the world is uniform, and one, and moral; that virtue
and right shall finally have the advantage, and prevail over fraud
and lawless force, over the deceits as well as the violence of
wickedness, under the conduct of one supreme governor: and
from the observations above made, it will appear that God has,
by our reason, given us to see a peculiar connection in the
several parts of this scheme, and a tendency towards the completion
of it, arising out of the very nature of virtue: which
tendency is to be considered as something moral in the essential
constitution of things. If any one should think all this to be of
little importance, I desire him to consider, what he would think,
if vice had, essentially and in its nature, these advantageous
tendencies; or if virtue had essentially the contrary ones.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that notwithstanding all these natural
effects and natural tendencies of virtue, yet things may be now
going on throughout the universe, and may go on hereafter, in
the same mixed way as here at present upon earth: virtue sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
prosperous, sometimes depressed; vice sometimes punished,
sometimes successful.</p>

<p>The answer to which is, that it is not the purpose of this
chapter, nor of this treatise, properly to prove God’s perfect
moral government over the world, or the truth of religion; but
to observe what there is in the constitution and course of nature,
to confirm the proper proof of it, supposed to be known: and
that the weight of the foregoing observations to this purpose may
be thus distinctly proved. Pleasure and pain are, to a certain
degree, say to a very high degree, distributed among us without
any apparent regard to the merit or demerit of characters. And
were there nothing else concerning this matter discernible in the
constitution and course of nature, there would be no ground
from the constitution and course of nature, to hope or to fear
that men would be rewarded or punished hereafter according to
their deserts: which, however, it is to be remarked, implies, that
even then there would be no ground from appearances to think,
that vice upon the whole would have the advantage, rather than
that virtue would. Thus the proof of a future state of retribution
would rest upon the usual known arguments for it; which are
I think plainly unanswerable; and would be so, though there
were no additional confirmation of them from the things above
insisted on. But these things are a very strong confirmation
of them. For,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, They show that the Author of nature is not indifferent
to virtue and vice. They amount to a declaration, from him,
determinate and not to be evaded, in favor of one, and against
the other; such a declaration, as there is nothing to be set over
against or answer, on the part of vice. So that were a man,
laying aside the proper proof of religion, to determine from the
course of nature only, whether it were most probable, that the
righteous or the wicked would have the advantage in a future
life; there can be no doubt, but that he would determine the
probability to be, that the former would. The course of nature
then, in the view of it now given, furnishes us with a real practical
proof of the obligations of religion.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, When, conformably to what religion teaches us, God
shall reward and punish virtue and vice as such, so as that every
one shall, upon the whole, have his deserts; this distributive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
justice will not be a thing different in <em>kind</em>, but only in <em>degree</em>,
from what we experience in his present government. It will be
that in <em>effect</em>, towards which we now see a <em>tendency</em>. It will be
no more than the <em>completion</em> of that moral government, the <em>principles
and beginning</em> of which have been shown, beyond all
dispute, discernible in the present constitution and course of
nature.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, As under the <em>natural</em> government of God, our experience
of those kinds and degrees of happiness and misery, which
we do experience at present, gives just ground to hope for, and
to fear, higher degrees and other kinds of both in a future state,
supposing a future state admitted: so under his <em>moral</em> government
our experience, that virtue and vice are, in the manners
above mentioned, actually rewarded and punished at present, in
a certain degree, gives just ground to hope and to fear, that they
<em>may be</em> rewarded and punished in a higher degree hereafter. It
is acknowledged indeed that this alone is not sufficient ground to
think, that they <em>actually will be</em> rewarded and punished in a
higher degree, rather than in a lower: but then,</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, There is sufficient ground to think so, from the good
and bad tendencies of virtue and vice. For these tendencies are
essential, and founded in the nature of things: whereas the
hinderances to their becoming effect are, in numberless cases, not
necessary, but artificial only. Now it may be much more strongly
argued, that these tendencies, as well as the actual rewards and
punishments, of virtue and vice, which arise directly out of the
nature of things, will remain hereafter, than that the accidental
hinderances of them will. And if these hinderances do not
remain; those rewards and punishments cannot but be carried
on much farther towards the perfection of moral government:
<i>i.e.</i> the tendencies of virtue and vice will become effect; but
when, or where, or in what particular way, cannot be known at
all, but by revelation.</p>

<p>Upon the whole: there is a kind of moral government implied
in God’s natural government:<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> virtue and vice are naturally rewarded
and punished as beneficial and mischievous to society;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and rewarded and punished directly as virtue and vice.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The
notion of a moral scheme of government is not fictitious, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
natural; for it is suggested to our thoughts by the constitution
and course of nature: and the execution of this scheme is
actually begun, in the instances here mentioned. And these
things are to be considered as a declaration of the Author of
nature, for virtue, and against vice: they give a credibility to
the supposition of their being rewarded and punished hereafter;
and also ground to hope and to fear, that they may be rewarded
and punished in higher degrees than they are here. All this is
confirmed, and the argument for religion, from the constitution
and course of nature, is carried on farther, by observing, that
there are natural tendencies, and, in innumerable cases, only artificial
hinderances, to this moral scheme’s being carried on much
farther towards perfection, than it is at present.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The notion then of a moral scheme of government, much more
perfect than what is seen, is not a fictitious, but a natural notion;
for it is suggested to our thoughts, by the essential tendencies of
virtue and vice. These tendencies are to be considered as intimations,
as implicit promises and threatenings, from the Author
of nature, of much greater rewards and punishments to follow
virtue and vice, than do at present. Indeed, every <em>natural</em> tendency,
which is to continue, but which is hindered from becoming
effect by only <em>accidental</em> causes, affords a presumption, that
such tendency will, some time or other, become effect: a presumption
proportionable in degree to the length of the duration,
through which such tendency will continue. From these things
together, arises a real presumption, that the moral scheme of
government established in nature, shall be carried on much
farther towards perfection hereafter; and, I think, a presumption
that it will be absolutely completed. From these things, joined
with the moral nature which God has given us, considered as
given us by him, arises a practical proof<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> that it <em>will</em> be completed:
a proof from fact; and therefore a distinct one from
that which is deduced from the eternal and unalterable relations,
the fitness and unfitness of actions.</p>

<span class="smaller">PROBATION, AS IMPLYING TRIAL, DIFFICULTIES, AND
DANGER.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span></h3>

<p>The general doctrine of religion, that our present life is a
state of probation for a future one, comprehends under it several
particular things, distinct from each other. The first and most
common meaning of it seems to be, that our future interest is
now depending, and depending upon ourselves; that we have
scope and opportunities here, for that good and bad behavior,
which God will reward and punish hereafter; together with
temptations to one, as well as inducements of reason to the other.
And this, in a great measure, is the same as saying, that we are
under the moral government of God, and to give an account of
our actions to him. For the notion of a future account and
general righteous judgment, implies some sort of temptations to
what is wrong: otherwise there would be no moral possibility of
doing wrong, nor ground for judgment, or discrimination. But
there is this difference, that the word <em>probation</em> is more distinctly
and particularly expressive of allurements to wrong, or
difficulties in adhering uniformly to what is right, and of the
danger of miscarrying by such temptations, than the words <em>moral
government</em>. A state of probation then, as thus particularly implying
in it trial, difficulties, and danger, may require to be
considered distinctly by itself.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>As the moral government of God, which religion teaches us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
implies that we are in a state of trial with regard to a future
world, so also his natural government over us implies that we
are in a state of trial, in the like sense, with regard to the present
world. Natural government by rewards and punishments,
as much implies natural trial, as moral government does moral
trial. The natural government of God here meant,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> consists in
his annexing pleasure to some actions, and pain to others, which
are in our power to do or forbear, and giving us notice of such
appointment, beforehand. This necessarily implies, that he has
made our happiness and misery, or our interest, to depend in part
upon ourselves. So far as men have temptations to any course of
action, which will probably occasion them greater temporal inconvenience
and uneasiness, than satisfaction, so far their temporal
interest is in danger from themselves; or they are in a state of
trial with respect to it. Now people often blame others, and even
themselves, for their misconduct in their temporal concerns. And
we find many are greatly wanting to themselves, and miss that
natural happiness, which they might have obtained in the present
life: perhaps every one does in some degree. But many run
themselves into great inconvenience, and into extreme distress
and misery, not through incapacity of knowing better, and doing
better, for themselves, which would be nothing to the present
purpose, but through their own fault. These things necessarily
imply temptation, and danger of miscarrying, in a greater or less
degree, with respect to our worldly interest or happiness. Every
one too, without having religion in his thoughts, speaks of the
hazards which young people run, upon their setting out in the
world: hazards from other causes, than merely their ignorance,
and unavoidable accidents. And some courses of vice, at least,
being contrary to men’s worldly interest or good; temptations to
these must at the same time be temptations to forego our present
and our future interest.</p>

<p>Thus in our natural or temporal capacity, we are in a state of
trial, <i>i.e.</i> of difficulty and danger, analogous, or like to our moral
and religious trial. This will more distinctly appear to any one,
who thinks it worth while, more distinctly, to consider, what it
is which constitutes our trial in both capacities, and to observe,
how mankind behave under it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>That which constitutes this trial, in both these capacities, must
be something either in our external circumstances, or in our
nature. For, on the one hand, persons may be betrayed into
wrong behavior upon surprise, or overcome upon any other very
singular and extraordinary external occasions, who would, otherwise,
have preserved their character of prudence and of virtue:
in which cases, every one, in speaking of the wrong behavior of
these persons, would impute it to such particular external circumstances.
On the other hand, men who have contracted habits of
vice and folly of any kind, or have some particular passions in
excess, will seek opportunities, and, as it were, go out of their
way, to gratify themselves in these respects, at the expense of
their wisdom and their virtue; led to it, as every one would say,
not by external temptations, but by such habits and passions.
And the account of this last case is, that particular passions are
no more coincident with prudence, or that reasonable self-love,
the end of which is our worldly interest, than they are with the
principle of virtue and religion; but often draw contrary ways
to one, as well as to the other: and so such particular passions
are as much temptations, to act imprudently with regard to our
worldly interest, as to act viciously.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> When we say, men are
misled by external circumstances of temptation; it cannot but be
understood, that there is somewhat within themselves, to render
those circumstances temptations, or to render them susceptible of
impressions from them. So when we say, they are misled by
passions; it is always supposed, that there are occasions, circumstances,
and objects, exciting these passions, and affording means
for gratifying them. Therefore, temptations from within, and
from without, coincide, and mutually imply each other. The
several external objects of the appetites, passions, and affections,
being present to the senses, or offering themselves to the mind,
and so exciting emotions suitable to their nature; not only in
cases where they can be gratified consistently with innocence and
prudence, but also in cases where they cannot, and yet can be
gratified imprudently and viciously: this as really puts them in
danger of voluntarily foregoing their present interest or good, as
their future; and as really renders self-denial necessary to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
one, as the other: <i>i.e.</i> we are in a like state of trial with respect
to both, by the very same passions, excited by the very same
means.</p>

<p>Thus mankind having a temporal interest depending upon
themselves, and a prudent course of behavior being necessary to
secure it, passions inordinately excited, whether by means of
example, or by any other external circumstance, towards such
objects, at such times, or in such degrees, as that they cannot be
gratified consistently with worldly prudence, are temptations;
dangerous, and too often successful temptations, to forego a
greater temporal good for a less; <i>i.e.</i> to forego what is, upon the
whole, our temporal interest, for the sake of a present gratification.
This is a description of our state of trial in our temporal
capacity. Substitute now the word <em>future</em> for <em>temporal</em>, and
<em>virtue</em> for <em>prudence</em>; and it will be just as proper a description
of our state of trial in our religious capacity; so analogous are
they to each other.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>If, from consideration of this our like state of trial in both capacities,
we go on to observe farther, how mankind behave under it;
we shall find there are some, who have so little sense of it, that
they scarce look beyond the passing day: they are so taken up with
present gratifications, as to have, in a manner, no feeling of consequences,
no regard to their future ease or fortune in this life:
any more than to their happiness in another. Some appear to be
blinded and deceived by inordinate passion, in their worldly concerns,
as much as in religion. Others are not deceived, but as it
were forcibly carried away by the like passions, against their
better judgment, and feeble resolutions too of acting better.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> And
there are men, and truly not a few, who shamelessly avow, not
their interest, but their mere will and pleasure, to be their law
of life: and who, in open defiance of every thing reasonable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
will go on in a course of vicious extravagance, foreseeing, with
no remorse and little fear, that it will be their temporal ruin;
and some of them, under the apprehension of the consequences
of wickedness in another state. To speak in the most moderate
way, human creatures are not only continually liable to go wrong
voluntarily, but we see likewise that they often actually do so,
with respect to their temporal interests, as well as with respect
to religion.</p>

<p>Thus our difficulties and dangers, or our trials in our temporal
and our religious capacity, as they proceed from the same causes,
and have the same effect upon men’s behavior, are evidently analogous,
and of the same kind.</p>

<p>It may be added, that the difficulties and dangers of miscarrying
in our religious state of trial, are greatly increased, and one
is ready to think, are in a manner wholly <em>made</em>, by the ill
behavior of others; by a wrong education, wrong in a moral
sense, sometimes positively vicious; by general bad example; by
the dishonest artifices which are got into business of all kinds;
and, in very many parts of the world, by religion’s being corrupted
into superstitions, which indulge men in their vices. In
like manner, the difficulties of conducting ourselves prudently
in respect to our present interest, and our danger of being led
aside from pursuing it, are greatly increased, by a foolish education;
and, after we come to mature age, by the extravagance and
carelessness of others, with whom we have intercourse: and by
mistaken notions, very generally prevalent, and taken up from
common opinion, concerning temporal happiness, and wherein it
consists.</p>

<p>Persons, by their own <em>negligence</em> and <em>folly</em> in temporal affairs, no
less than by a course of vice, bring themselves into new difficulties,
and, by habits of indulgence, become less qualified to go through
them: and one irregularity after another, embarrasses things to
such a degree, that they know not whereabout they are; and
often makes the path of conduct so intricate and perplexed, that
it is difficult to trace it out; difficult even to determine what is
the prudent or the moral part. Thus, for instance, wrong behavior
in one stage of life, youth; wrong, I mean considering
ourselves only in our temporal capacity, without taking in religion;
this, in several ways, increases the difficulties of right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
behavior in mature age; <i>i.e.</i> puts us into a more disadvantageous
state of trial in our temporal capacity.</p>

<p>We are an inferior part of the creation of God. There are
natural appearances of our being in a state of degradation.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> We
certainly are in a condition, which <em>does not seem</em>, by any means,
the most advantageous we could imagine or desire, either in our
natural or moral capacity, for securing either our present or
future interest. However, this condition, low, and careful, and
uncertain as it is, does not afford any just ground of complaint.
For, as men <em>may</em> manage their temporal affairs with prudence,
and so pass their days here on earth in tolerable ease and satisfaction,
by a moderate degree of care: so likewise with regard to
religion, there is no more required than what they are well able
to do,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and what they must be greatly wanting to themselves, if
they neglect. And for persons to have that put upon them,
which they are well able to go through, and no more, we naturally
consider as an equitable thing; supposing it done by proper
authority. Nor have we any more reason to complain of it, with
regard to the Author of nature, than of his not having given us
advantages belonging to other orders of creatures.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>] The thing here insisted upon is, that the state
of trial, which religion teaches us we are in, is rendered credible,
by its being throughout uniform and of a piece with the general
conduct of Providence towards us, in all other respects within
the compass of our knowledge. Indeed if mankind, considered
in their natural capacity, as inhabitants of this world only, found
themselves, from their birth to their death, in a settled state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
security and happiness, without any solicitude or thought of their
own: or if they were in no danger of being brought into inconveniences
and distress, by carelessness, or the folly of passion,
through bad example, the treachery of others, or the deceitful
appearances of things: were this our natural condition, then it
might seem strange, and be some presumption against the truth
of religion, that it represents our future and more general interest,
as not secure <em>of course</em>, but as depending upon our behavior,
and requiring recollection and self-government to obtain it.
It <em>then</em> might be alleged, “What you say is our condition, in one
respect, is not in any wise of a sort with what we find, by experience,
is our condition in another. Our whole present interest
is secured to our hands, without any solicitude of ours; and why
should not our future interest, if we have any such, be so too?”
But since, on the contrary, thought and consideration, the voluntary
denying ourselves many things which we desire, and a course
of behavior, far from being always agreeable to us, are absolutely
necessary to our acting even a common decent, and common
prudent part, so as to pass with any satisfaction through the
<em>present</em> world, and be received upon any tolerable good terms
in it: since this is the case, all presumption against self-denial
and attention being necessary to secure our <em>higher</em> interest,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> is
removed.</p>

<p>Had we not experience, it might, perhaps speciously, be urged,
that it is improbable any thing of hazard and danger should be
put upon us by an infinite being; when every thing which has
hazard and danger in our manner of conception, and will end in
error, confusion, and misery, is already certain in his foreknowledge.
Indeed, why any thing of hazard and danger should be
put upon such frail creatures as we are, may well be thought a
difficulty in speculation; and cannot but be so, till we know the
whole, or at least much more of the case. But still the constitution
of nature is as it is. Our happiness and misery are trusted
to our conduct, and made to depend upon it. Somewhat, and,
in many circumstances, a great deal too, is put upon us, either to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
do, or to suffer, as we choose. All the various miseries of life,
which people bring upon themselves by negligence and folly,
and might have avoided by proper care, are instances of this:
which miseries are, beforehand, just as contingent and undetermined
as conduct, and left to be determined by it.</p>

<p>These observations are an answer<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> to the objections against the
credibility of a state of trial, as implying temptations, and real
danger of miscarrying with regard to our general interest, under
the moral government of God. And they show, that, if we are
at all to be considered in such a capacity, and as having such an
interest, the general analogy of Providence must lead us to apprehend
ourselves in danger of miscarrying, in different degrees,
as to this interest, by our neglecting to act the proper part belonging
to us in that capacity. For we have a present interest
under the government of God, which we experience here upon
earth. This interest, as it is not forced upon us, so neither is it
offered to our acceptance, but to our acquisition; and in such
manner, as that we are in danger of missing it, by means of
temptations to neglect, or act contrary to it; and without attention
and self-denial, we must and do miss it. It is then perfectly
credible, that this may be our case, with respect to that chief and
final good, which religion proposes to us.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">PROBATION, AS INTENDED FOR MORAL DISCIPLINE
AND IMPROVEMENT.</span></h3>

<p>From the consideration of our being in a probation-state, of
so much difficulty and hazard, naturally arises the question, how
we came to be placed in it? But such a general inquiry as this
would be found involved in insuperable difficulties. For, though
some of these difficulties would be lessened, by observing that all
wickedness is voluntary, as is implied in its very notion; and
that many of the miseries of life have apparent good effects:
yet, when we consider other circumstances belonging to both,
and what must be the consequence of the former in a life to
come, it cannot but be acknowledged plain folly and presumption,
to pretend to give an account of the <em>whole reasons</em> of this
matter; the whole reasons of our being allotted a condition, out
of which so much wickedness and misery, so circumstanced,
would in fact arise. Whether it be not beyond our faculties, not
only to find out, but even to understand; or, though we should
be supposed capable of understanding it, yet, whether it would
be of service or prejudice to us to be informed of it, is impossible
to say. But as our present condition can in no wise be
shown to be inconsistent with the perfect moral government of
God: so religion teaches us we were placed in it, that we might
qualify ourselves, by the practice of virtue, for another state
which is to follow it. This, though but a partial answer, a very
partial one indeed, to the inquiry now mentioned; is yet a more
satisfactory answer to another, which is of real, and of the utmost
importance to us to have answered,&mdash;viz.: What is our business
here? The known end then, why we are placed in a state of so
much affliction, hazard, and difficulty, is, our improvement in
virtue and piety, as the requisite qualification for a future state
of security and happiness.</p>

<p>The beginning of life, considered as an education for mature
age in the present world, appears plainly, at first sight, analogous
to this our trial for a future one: the former being in our temporal
capacity, what the latter is in our religious capacity. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
observations common to both, and a more distinct consideration
of each, will more distinctly show the extent and force of the
analogy between them; and the credibility, which arises from
hence, as well as from the nature of the thing, that the present
life was intended to be a state of discipline for a future one.</p>

<p>I. Every species of creatures is, we see, designed for a particular
way of life; to which, the nature, the capacities, temper,
and qualifications, of each species, are as necessary as their external
circumstances. Both come into the notion of such state,
or particular way of life, and are constituent parts of it. Change
a man’s capacities or character, to the degree in which it is conceivable
they may be changed, and he would be altogether incapable
of a human course of life, and human happiness; as
incapable, as if, his nature continuing unchanged, he were placed
in a world, where he had no sphere of action, nor any objects to
answer his appetites, passions, and affections of any sort. One
thing is set over against another, as an ancient writer expresses
it.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Our nature corresponds to our external condition. Without
this correspondence, there would be no possibility of any such
thing as human life and happiness: which life and happiness are,
therefore, a <em>result</em> from our nature and condition jointly: meaning
by human life, not living in the literal sense, but the whole
complex notion commonly understood by those words. So that
without determining what will be the employment and happiness,
the particular life, of good men hereafter; there must be some
determinate capacities, some necessary character and qualifications,
without which persons cannot but be utterly incapable of
it: in like manner, as there must be some, without which men
would be incapable of their present state of life.</p>

<p>II. The constitution of human creatures, and indeed of all
creatures which come under our notice, is such, as that they are
capable of naturally becoming qualified for states of life, for
which they were once wholly unqualified. In imagination we
may indeed conceive of creatures, incapable of having any of
their faculties naturally enlarged, or as being unable naturally
to acquire any new qualifications. But the faculties of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
species known to us, are made for enlargement; for acquirements
of experience and habits. We find ourselves, in particular, endued
with capacities, not only of perceiving ideas, and of knowledge
or perceiving truth, but also of storing up ideas and knowledge
by memory. We are capable, not only of acting, and of
having different momentary impressions made upon us; but of
getting a new facility in any kind of action, and of settled alterations
in our temper or character. The power of the two last is
the power of habits. But neither the perception of ideas, nor
knowledge of any sort, are habits; though absolutely necessary to
the forming of them. However, apprehension, reason, memory,
which are the capacities of acquiring knowledge, are greatly improved
by exercise. Whether the word habit is applicable to all
these improvements, and in particular how far the powers of
memory and of habits may be powers of the same nature, I shall
not inquire. But that perceptions come into our minds readily
and of course, by means of their having been there before, seems
a thing of the same sort, as readiness in any particular kind of
action, proceeding from being accustomed to it. Aptness to recollect
practical observations, of service in our conduct, is plainly
habit in many cases. There are habits of perception, and habits
of action. An instance of the former, is our constant and even
involuntary readiness, in correcting the impressions of our sight
concerning magnitudes and distances, so as to substitute judgment
in the room of sensation, imperceptibly to ourselves. It
seems as if all other associations of ideas not naturally connected,
might be called passive habits; as properly as our readiness in
understanding languages upon sight, or hearing of words. Our
readiness in speaking and writing them, are instances of active
habits.</p>

<p>For distinctness, we may consider habits, as belonging to the
body, or to the mind: and the latter will be explained by the
former. Under the former are comprehended all bodily activities
or motions, whether graceful or unbecoming, which are owing to
use: under the latter, general habits of life and conduct; such as
those of obedience and submission to authority, or to any particular
person; those of veracity, justice, and charity; those of
attention, industry, self-government, envy, revenge. Habits of
this latter kind seem produced by repeated acts, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
former. And as habits belonging to the body are produced by
external <em>acts</em>, so habits of the mind are produced by the <em>exertion</em>
of inward practical principles; <i>i.e.</i> by carrying them into act, or
acting upon them; the principles of obedience, of veracity, justice,
and charity. Nor can those habits be formed by any external
course of action, otherwise than as it proceeds from these principles:
because it is only these inward principles exerted, which
are strictly acts of obedience, of veracity, of justice, and of
charity.</p>

<p>So likewise habits of attention, industry, self-government, are
in the same manner acquired by exercise; and habits of envy and
revenge by indulgence, whether in outward act, or in thought
and intention; <i>i.e.</i> inward act: for such intention is an act.
Resolutions to do well, are also properly acts. And endeavoring
to enforce upon our own minds a practical sense of virtue, or to
beget in others that practical sense of it, which a man really has
himself, is a virtuous act. All these, therefore, may and will
contribute towards forming good habits. But going over the
theory of virtue in one’s thoughts, talking well, and drawing fine
pictures, of it; this is so far from necessarily or certainly conducing
to form a habit of it, in him who thus employs himself, that
it may harden the mind in a contrary course, and render it gradually
more insensible; <i>i.e.</i> form a habit of insensibility to all moral
considerations. For, from our very faculty of habits, passive impressions,
by being repeated, grow weaker. Thoughts, by often
passing through the mind, are felt less sensibly: being accustomed
to danger, begets intrepidity, <i>i.e.</i> lessens fear; to distress,
lessens the passion of pity; to instances of others’ mortality,
lessens the sensible apprehension of our own.</p>

<p>From these two observations together, that practical habits are
formed and strengthened by repeated acts, and that passive impressions
grow weaker by being repeated upon us, it must follow,
that active habits may be gradually forming and strengthening,
by a course of acting upon such and such motives and excitements,
while these motives and excitements themselves are, by
proportionable degrees, growing less sensible; <i>i.e.</i> are continually
less and less sensibly felt, even as the active habits strengthen.
And experience confirms this: for active principles, at the very
time that they are less lively in perception than they were, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
found to be, somehow, wrought more thoroughly into the temper
and character, and become more effectual in influencing our practice.
The three things just mentioned may afford instances of it.
Perception of danger is a natural excitement of passive fear, and
active caution: and by being inured to danger, habits of the latter
are gradually wrought, at the same time that the former gradually
lessens. Perception of distress in others is a natural excitement,
passively to pity, and actively to relieve it: but let a man set
himself to attend to, inquire out, and relieve distressed persons,
and he cannot but grow less and less sensibly affected with the
various miseries of life, with which he must become acquainted;
when yet, at the same time, benevolence, considered not as a
passion, but as a practical principle of action, will strengthen:
and while he passively compassionates the distressed less, he will
acquire a greater aptitude actively to assist and befriend them.
So also at the same time that the daily instances of men’s dying
around us give us daily a less sensible passive feeling or apprehension
of our own mortality, such instances greatly contribute to
the strengthening a practical regard to it in serious men; <i>i.e.</i> to
forming a habit of acting with a constant view to it.</p>

<p>This seems further to show, that passive impressions made
upon our minds by admonition, experience, or example, though
they may have a remote efficacy, and a very great one, towards
forming active habits, yet can have this efficacy no otherwise
than by inducing us to such a course of action: and that it is not
being <em>affected</em> so and so, but acting, which forms those habits:
only it must be always remembered, that real endeavors to enforce
good impressions upon ourselves are a species of virtuous action.
Nor do we know how far it is possible, in the nature of things,
that effects should be wrought in us at once, equivalent to habits;
<i>i.e.</i> what is wrought by use and exercise. The thing insisted on
is, not what may be possible, but what is in fact the appointment
of nature: which is, that active habits are to be formed by exercise.
Their progress may be so gradual, as to be imperceptible
in its steps: it may be hard to explain the faculty, by which we
are capable of habits, throughout its several parts; and to trace
it up to its original, so as to distinguish it from all others in our
mind: and it seems as if contrary effects were to be ascribed to
it. But the thing in general, that our nature is formed to yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to use and exercise, in some such manner as this, is matter of
certain experience.</p>

<p>Thus, by accustoming ourselves to any course of action, we get
an aptness to go on, a facility, readiness, and often pleasure, in
it. The inclinations which rendered us averse to it, grow weaker;
the difficulties in it, not only the imaginary but the real ones,
lessen; the reasons for it offer themselves of course to our thoughts
upon all occasions; and the least glimpse of them is sufficient to
make us go on, in a course of action, to which we have been accustomed.
Practical principles appear to grow stronger, absolutely
in themselves, by exercise; as well as relatively, with
regard to contrary principles; which, by being accustomed to
submit, do so habitually, and of course. Thus a new character,
in several respects, may be formed; and many habitudes of life,
not given by nature, but which nature directs us to acquire.</p>

<p>III. Indeed we may be assured, that we should never have had
these capacities of improving by experience, acquired knowledge,
and habits, had they not been necessary, and intended to be made
use of. And accordingly we find them so necessary, and so much
intended, that without them we should be utterly incapable of
that which was the end for which we were made, considered in
our temporal capacity only: the employments and satisfactions
of our mature state of life.</p>

<p>Nature does in no wise qualify us wholly, much less at once, for
this mature state of life. Even maturity of understanding, and
bodily strength, not only are arrived at gradually, but are also
very much owing to the continued exercise of our powers of body
and mind from infancy. If we suppose a person brought into
the world with both these in maturity, as far as this is conceivable,
he would plainly at first be as unqualified for the human life of
mature age, as an idiot. He would be in a manner distracted,
with astonishment, and apprehension, and curiosity, and suspense:
nor can one guess, how long it would be, before he would be
familiarized to himself and the objects about him, enough even to
set himself to any thing. It may be questioned too, whether the
natural information of his sight and hearing would be of any
manner of use to him in acting, before experience. And it seems,
that men would be strangely headstrong and self-willed, and disposed
to exert themselves with an impetuosity, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
render society insupportable, and the living in it impracticable,
were it not for some acquired moderation and self-government, some
aptitude and readiness in restraining themselves, and concealing
their sense of things. Want of every thing of this kind which
is learnt would render a man as incapable of society, as want of
language would; or as his natural ignorance of any of the particular
employments of life would render him incapable of providing
himself with the common conveniences, or supplying the
necessary wants of it. In these respects, and probably in many
more of which we have no particular notion, mankind is left by
nature, an unformed, unfinished creature; utterly deficient and
unqualified, before the acquirement of knowledge, experience,
and habits, for that mature state of life, which was the end of
his creation, considering him as related only to this world.</p>

<p>But, as nature has endued us with a power of supplying those
deficiencies, by acquired knowledge, experience, and habits; so
likewise we are placed in a condition, in infancy, childhood, and
youth, fitted for it; fitted for our acquiring those qualifications
of all sorts, which we stand in need of in mature age. Hence
children, from their very birth, are daily growing acquainted
with the objects about them, with the scene in which they are
placed, and to have a future part; and learning something or other,
necessary to the performance of it. The subordinations, to which
they are accustomed in domestic life, teach them self-government
in common behavior abroad, and prepare them for subjection and
obedience to civil authority.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> What passes before their eyes, and
daily happens to them, gives them experience, caution against
treachery and deceit, together with numberless little rules of
action and conduct, which we could not live without; and which
are learnt so insensibly and so perfectly, as to be mistaken perhaps
for instinct, though they are the effect of long experience
and exercise; as much so as language, or knowledge in particular
business, or the qualifications and behavior belonging to the
several ranks and professions. Thus the beginning of our days
is adapted to be, and is, a state of education in the theory and
practice of mature life. We are much assisted in it by example,
instruction, and the care of others; but a great deal is left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ourselves to do. And of this, as part is done easily and of
course; so part requires diligence and care, the voluntary foregoing
many things which we desire, and setting ourselves to what
we should have no inclination to, but for the necessity or expedience
of it. For that labor and industry, which the station of
so many absolutely requires, they would be greatly unqualified
for, in maturity, as those in other stations would be for any other
sorts of application; if both were not accustomed to them in
their youth. And, according as persons behave themselves, in
the general education which all go through, and in the particular
ones adapted to particular employments, their character is
formed,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and made to appear; they recommend themselves more
or less; and are capable of, and placed in, different stations in
society.</p>

<p>The former part of life, then, is to be considered as an important
opportunity, which nature puts into our hands; and
which, when lost is not to be recovered. And our being placed
in a state of discipline throughout this life, for another world, is
a providential disposition of things, exactly of the same kind, as
our being placed in a state of discipline during childhood, for
mature age. Our condition in both respects is uniform and of a
piece, and comprehended under one and the same general law
of nature.</p>

<p>If we were not able at all to discern, how or in what way the
present life could be our preparation for another; this would be
no objection against the credibility of its being so. We do not
discern, how food and sleep contribute to the growth of the
body; nor could have any thought that they would, before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
had experience. Nor do children at all think, on the one hand,
that the sports and exercises, to which they are so much addicted,
contribute to their health and growth; nor, on the other, of the
necessity which there is for their being restrained in them. Nor
are they capable of understanding the use of many parts of discipline,
which nevertheless they must be made to go through, in
order to qualify them for the business of mature age. Were we
not able then to discover, in what respects the present life could
form us for a future one; yet nothing would be more supposable
than that it might, in some respects or other, from the general
analogy of Providence. And this, for aught I see, might reasonably
be said, even though we should not take in the consideration
of God’s moral government over the world. But,</p>

<p>IV. Take in this consideration, and consequently, that the
character of virtue and piety is a necessary qualification for the
future state, and then we may distinctly see, how, and in what
respects, the present life may be a preparation for it; since we
<em>want, and are capable of, improvement in that character, by
moral and religious habits</em>; and <em>the present life is fit to be a
state of discipline for such improvement</em>: in like manner as we
have already observed, how, and in what respects, infancy, childhood,
and youth, are a necessary preparation, and a natural state
of discipline, for mature age.</p>

<p>Nothing which we at present see, would lead us to the thought
of a solitary inactive state hereafter. If we judge at all from
the analogy of nature, we must suppose, according to the Scripture
account of it, that it will be a community. And there is no
shadow of any thing unreasonable in conceiving, though there
be no analogy for it, that this community will be, as the Scripture
represents it, under the more immediate, or, if such an expression
may be used, the more sensible government of God.
Nor is our ignorance, what will be the employments of this
happy community, nor our consequent ignorance, what particular
scope or occasion there will be for the exercise of veracity,
justice, and charity, among the members of it with regard to
each other, any proof, that there will be no sphere of exercise
for those virtues. Much less, if that were possible, is our ignorance
any proof, that there will be no occasion for that frame of
mind, or character, which is formed by the daily practice of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
particular virtues here, and which is a result from it.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This at
least must be owned in general, that, as the government established
in the universe is moral, the character of virtue and
piety must, in some way or other, be the <em>condition</em> of our happiness
or the qualification for it.</p>

<p>From what is above observed, concerning our natural power of
habits, it is easy to see, that we are <em>capable</em> of moral improvement
by discipline. And how greatly we <em>want</em> it, need not be
proved to any one who is acquainted with the great wickedness
of mankind; or even with those imperfections, which the best
are conscious of. But it is not perhaps distinctly attended to by
every one, that the occasion which human creatures have for discipline,
to improve in them this character of virtue and piety, is
to be traced up higher than to excess in the passions, by indulgence
and habits of vice. Mankind, and perhaps all finite
creatures, from the very constitution of their nature, before
habits of virtue, are deficient, and in danger of deviating from
what is right; and therefore stand in need of virtuous habits, for
a security against this danger. For, together with the general
principle of moral understanding, we have in our inward frame
various affections towards particular external objects. These
affections are naturally, and of right, subject to the government
of the moral principle, as to the occasions upon which they may
be gratified; as to the times, degrees, and manner, in which the
objects of them may be pursued. But the principle of virtue
can neither excite them, nor prevent their being excited. On the
contrary, they are naturally felt, when the objects of them are
present to the mind, not only before all consideration whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
they can be obtained by lawful means, but after it is found they
cannot. The natural objects of affection continue so; the necessaries,
conveniences, and pleasures of life, remain naturally desirable,
though they cannot be obtained innocently: nay, though
they cannot possibly be obtained at all. And when the objects
of any affection whatever cannot be obtained without unlawful
means; but may be obtained by them: such affection, though its
being excited, and its continuing some time in the mind, be as
innocent as it is natural and necessary, yet cannot but be conceived
to have a <em>tendency</em> to incline persons to venture upon such
unlawful means: and therefore must be conceived as putting
them in some danger of it. Now what is the general security
against this danger, against their actually deviating from right?
As the danger is, so also must the security be, from within: from
the practical principle of virtue.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The strengthening or improving
this principle, considered as practical, or as a principle of action,
will lessen the danger, or increase the security against it. And
this moral principle is capable of improvement, by proper discipline
and exercise: by recollecting the practical impressions
which example and experience have made upon us: and, instead
of following humor and mere inclination, by continually attending
to the equity and right of the case, in whatever we are engaged,
be it in greater or less matters; and accustoming ourselves always
to act upon it, as being itself the just and natural motive of action;
and as this moral course of behavior must necessarily, under the
divine government, be our final interest. <em>Thus the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
virtue, improved into a habit, of which improvement we are thus
capable, will plainly be, in proportion to the strength of it, a
security against the danger which finite creatures are in, from
the very nature of propension, or particular affections.</em> This
way of putting the matter, supposes particular affections to remain
in a future state; which it is scarce possible to avoid supposing.
And if they do; we clearly see, that acquired habits of
virtue and self-government may be necessary for the regulation
of them. However, though we were not distinctly to take in
this supposition, but to speak only in general; the thing really
comes to the same. For habits of virtue, thus acquired by discipline,
are improvement in virtue: and improvement in virtue
must be advancement in happiness, if the government of the
universe be moral.</p>

<p>From these things we may observe, (and it will further show
this our natural and original need of being improved by discipline,)
how it comes to pass, that creatures made upright, fall; and how
those who preserve their uprightness, raise themselves by so
doing, to a more secure state of virtue. To say that the former
is accounted for by the nature of liberty, is to say no more, than
that an event’s actually happening is accounted for by a mere
possibility of its happening. But it seems distinctly conceivable
from the very nature of particular affections or propensions. For,
suppose creatures intended for such a particular state of life, for
which such propensions were necessary: suppose them endued
with such propensions, together with moral understanding, as
well including a practical sense of virtue as a speculative perception
of it; and that all these several principles, both natural and
moral, forming an inward constitution of mind, were in the most
exact proportion possible; <i>i.e.</i> in a proportion the most exactly
adapted to their intended state of life; such creatures would be
made upright, or finitely perfect. Now particular propensions,
from their very nature, must be felt, the objects of them being
present; though they cannot be gratified at all, or not with the
allowance of the moral principle. If they can be gratified without
its allowance, or by contradicting it, then they must be conceived
to have some tendency, in how low a degree soever, yet some
tendency, to induce persons to such forbidden gratification. This
tendency, in some one particular propension, may be increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
by the greater frequency of occasions naturally exciting it, than
of occasions exciting others. The least voluntary indulgence in
forbidden circumstances,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> though but in thought, will increase
this wrong tendency; and may increase it further, till, peculiar
conjunctures perhaps conspiring, it becomes effect; and danger
of deviating from right, ends in actual deviation from it; a danger
necessarily arising from the very nature of propension, and which
therefore could not have been prevented, though it might have
been escaped, or got innocently through. The case would be, as
if we were to suppose a straight path marked out for a person, in
which a certain degree of attention would keep him steady: but
if he would not attend, in this degree, any one of a thousand
objects, catching his eye, might lead him out of it.</p>

<p>Now it is impossible to say, how much even the first full overt
act of irregularity might disorder the inward constitution; unsettle
the adjustments, and alter the proportions, which formed
it, and in which the uprightness of its make consisted: but repetition
of irregularities would produce habits. Thus the constitution
would be spoiled; and creatures made upright, become
corrupt and depraved in their settled character, proportionably to
their repeated irregularities in occasional acts,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
these creatures might have improved and raised themselves, to a
higher and more secure state of virtue, by the contrary behavior:
by steadily following the moral principle, supposed to be one part
of their nature: and thus <em>withstanding</em> that unavoidable danger
of defection, which necessarily arose from propension, the other
part of it. For, by thus preserving their integrity for some time,
their danger would lessen; since propensions, by being inured to
submit, would do it more easily and of course: and their security
against this lessening danger would increase; since the moral
principle would gain additional strength by exercise: both which
things are implied in the notion of virtuous habits.</p>

<p>Thus vicious indulgence is not only criminal in itself, but also
depraves the inward constitution and character. And virtuous
self-government is not only right in itself, but also improves the
inward constitution or character: and may improve it to such a
degree, that though we should suppose it impossible for particular
affections to be absolutely coincident with the moral principle;
and consequently should allow, that such creatures as have been
above supposed, would forever remain defectible, yet their danger
of actually deviating from right may be almost infinitely lessened,
and they fully fortified against what remains of it; if that may
be called danger, against which there is an adequate, effectual
security. Still, this their higher perfection may continue to consist
in habits of virtue formed in a state of discipline, and this
their more complete security remain to proceed from them.</p>

<p>Thus it is plainly conceivable, that creatures without blemish,
as they came out of the hands of God, may be in danger of going
wrong; and so may stand in need of the security of virtuous
habits, additional to the moral principle wrought into their natures
by him. That which is the ground of their danger, or their
want of security, maybe considered as a deficiency in themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to which virtuous habits are the natural supply. And as they
are naturally capable of being raised and improved by discipline,
it may be a thing fit and requisite, that they should be placed
in circumstances with an eye to it: in circumstances peculiarly
fitted to be to them a state of discipline for their improvement in
virtue.</p>

<p>But how much more strongly must this hold with respect to
those who have corrupted their natures, are fallen from their
original rectitude, and whose passions are become excessive by
repeated violations of their inward constitution! Upright creatures
may want to be improved: depraved creatures want to be
renewed. Education and discipline, which may be in all degrees
and sorts of gentleness and of severity, are expedient for those:
but must be absolutely necessary for these. For these, discipline
of the severer sort too, and in the higher degrees of it, must be
necessary, in order to wear out vicious habits; to recover their
primitive strength of self-government, which indulgence must
have weakened; to repair, as well as raise into a habit, the moral
principle, in order to their arriving at a secure state of virtuous
happiness.</p>

<p>Whoever will consider the thing, may clearly see that the
present world is <em>peculiarly fit</em> to be a state of discipline for this
purpose, to such as will set themselves to mend and improve.
For, the various temptations with which we are surrounded; our
experience of the deceits of wickedness; having been in many
instances led wrong ourselves; the great viciousness of the world;
the infinite disorders consequent upon it; our being made acquainted
with pain and sorrow, either from our own feeling of it,
or from the sight of it in others; these things, though some of
them may indeed produce wrong effects upon our minds, yet
when duly reflected upon, have, all of them, a direct tendency
to bring us to a settled moderation and reasonableness of temper:
the contrary both to thoughtless levity, and also to that unrestrained
self-will, and violent bent to follow present inclination,
which may be observed in undisciplined minds.</p>

<p>Such experience, as the present state affords, of the frailty
of our nature; of the boundless extravagance of ungoverned
passion; of the power which an infinite being has over us, by
the various capacities of misery which he has given us; in short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that kind and degree of experience, which the present state
affords us, that the constitution of nature is such as to admit
the possibility, the danger, and the actual event, or creatures
losing their innocence and happiness, and becoming vicious and
wretched; has a tendency to give us a practical sense of things
very different from a mere speculative knowledge, that we are
liable to vice, and capable of misery. And who knows, whether
the security of creatures in the highest and most settled state of
perfection, may not in part arise, from their having had such a
sense of things as this, formed, and habitually fixed within them,
in some state of probation. And passing through the present
world with that moral attention, which is necessary to the acting
a right part in it, may leave everlasting impressions of this sort
upon our minds.</p>

<p>To be a little more distinct: allurements to what is wrong,
difficulties in the discharge of our duty, our not being able to act
a uniform right part without some thought and care, and the
opportunities which we have, or imagine we have, of avoiding
what we dislike or obtaining what we desire, by unlawful means,
when we either cannot do it at all, or at least not so easily, by
lawful ones, these things, <i>i.e.</i> the snares and temptations of vice,
are what render the present world peculiarly fit to be a state of
discipline, to those who will preserve their integrity: because
they render being upon our guard, resolution, and the denial of
our passions, necessary in order to that end. The exercise of
such particular recollection, intention of mind, and self-government,
in the practice of virtue, has, from the make of our nature,
a peculiar tendency to form habits of virtue; as implying, not
only a real, but also a more continued, and a more intense exercise
of the virtuous principle, or a more constant and a stronger
effort of virtue exerted into act. Thus suppose a person to know
himself to be in particular danger, for some time, of doing any
thing wrong, which yet he fully resolves not to do; continued
recollection and keeping upon his guard, in order to make good
his resolution, is a <em>continued</em> exerting of that act of virtue
in a <em>high degree</em>, which need have been, and perhaps would
have been, only <em>instantaneous</em> and <em>weak</em>, had the temptation
been so.</p>

<p>It is indeed ridiculous to assert, that self-denial is essential to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
virtue and piety:<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but it would have been nearer the truth,
though not strictly the truth itself, to have said, that it is essential
to discipline and improvement. For though actions materially
virtuous, which have no sort of difficulty, but are perfectly
agreeable to our particular inclinations, may possibly be
done only from these particular inclinations, and so may not be
any exercise of the principle of virtue, <i>i.e.</i> not be virtuous actions
at all; yet, on the contrary, they <em>may</em> be an exercise of that
principle: and when they are, they have a tendency to form and
fix the habit of virtue. But when the exercise of the virtuous
principle is more continued, oftener repeated, and more intense;
as it must be in circumstances of danger, temptation, and difficulty,
of any kind and in any degree; this tendency is increased
proportionably, and a more confirmed habit is the consequence.</p>

<p>This undoubtedly holds to a certain length: but how far it
may hold, I know not. Neither our intellectual powers, nor our
bodily strength can be improved beyond a certain degree: and
both may be overwrought. Possibly there may be something
analogous to this, with respect to the moral character; which is
scarce worth considering. I mention it only, lest it should come
into some persons’ thoughts, not as an exception to the foregoing
observations, which perhaps it is; but as a confutation of them,
which it is not. And there may be several other exceptions.
Observations of this kind cannot be supposed to hold minutely,
and in every case. It is enough that they hold in general. And
these plainly hold so far, as that from them may be seen distinctly,
(which is all that is intended by them,) that <em>the present
world is peculiarly fit to be a state of discipline, for our improvement
in virtue and piety</em>: in the same sense as some
sciences, by requiring and engaging the attention, not to be sure
of such persons as will not, but of such as will, set themselves
to them, are fit to form the mind to habits of attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed the present state is so far from proving, in event, a discipline
of virtue to the generality of men, that on the contrary
they seem to make it a discipline of vice. And the viciousness
of the world is, in different ways, the great temptation which
renders it a state of virtuous discipline, in the degree it is, to
good men. The whole end, and the whole occasion, of mankind’s
being placed in such a state as the present, is not pretended
to be accounted for. That which appears amidst the
general corruption, is, that there are some persons, who, having
within them the principle of amendment and recovery, attend to
and follow the notices of virtue and religion, be they more clear
or more obscure, which are afforded them; and that the present
world is not only an exercise of virtue in these persons, but an
exercise of it in ways and degrees, peculiarly apt to improve it:
apt to improve it, in some respects, even beyond what would be,
by the exercise of it, required in a perfectly virtuous society, or
in a society of equally imperfect virtue with themselves. But
that the present world does not actually become a state of moral
discipline to many, even to the generality, <i>i.e.</i> that they do not
improve or grow better in it, cannot be urged as a proof, that it
was not intended for moral discipline, by any who at all observe
the analogy of nature. For, of the numerous seeds of vegetables
and bodies of animals, which are adapted and put in the way to
improve to such a point or state of natural maturity and perfection,
we do not see perhaps that one in a million actually does.
Far the greatest part of them decay before they are improved to
it; and appear to be absolutely destroyed. Yet no one, who does
not deny all final causes, will deny, that those seeds and bodies,
which do attain to that point of maturity and perfection, answer
the end for which they were really designed by nature; and
therefore that nature designed them for such perfection. I cannot
forbear adding, though it is not to the present purpose, that
the <em>appearance</em> of such an amazing <em>waste</em> in nature, with respect
to these seeds and bodies, by foreign causes, is to us as unaccountable,
as, what is much more terrible, the present and future ruin
of so many moral agents by themselves, <i>i.e.</i> by vice.</p>

<p>Against this whole notion of moral discipline, it may be objected,
in another way; that so far as a course of behavior,
materially virtuous, proceeds from hope and fear, so far it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a discipline and strengthening of self-love. But doing what God
commands, because he commands it, is obedience, though it proceeds
from hope or fear. A course of such obedience will form
habits of it. And a constant regard to veracity, justice, and
charity, may form distinct habits of these particular virtues; and
will certainly form habits of self-government, and of denying our
inclinations, whenever veracity, justice, or charity requires it.
Nor is there any foundation for this great nicety, with which
some affect to distinguish in this case, in order to depreciate all
religion proceeding from hope or fear. For, veracity, justice,
and charity, regard to God’s authority, and to our own chief interest,
are not only all three coincident; but each of them is, in
itself, a just and natural motive or principle of action. He who
begins a good life from any one of them, and perseveres in it, as
he is already in some degree, so he cannot fail of becoming more
and more, of that character which is correspondent to the constitution
of nature as moral; and to the relation which God
stands in to us as moral governor of it: nor consequently can he
fail of obtaining that happiness, which this constitution and relation
necessarily suppose connected with that character.</p>

<p>These several observations, concerning the active principle of
virtue and obedience to God’s commands, are applicable to passive
submission or resignation to his will: which is another essential
part of a right character, connected with the former, and
very much in our power to form ourselves to. It may be imagined,
that nothing but afflictions can give occasion for or require this
virtue; that it can have no respect to, nor be any way necessary
to qualify for, a state of perfect happiness: but it is not experience
which can make us think thus. Prosperity itself, while
any thing supposed desirable is not ours, begets extravagant and
unbounded thoughts. Imagination is altogether as much a source
of discontent, as any thing in our external condition. It is indeed
true, that there can be no scope for <em>patience</em>, when sorrow
shall be no more; but there may be need of a temper of mind,
which shall have been formed by patience. For, though self-love,
considered merely as an active principle leading us to pursue
our chief interest, cannot but be uniformly coincident with
the principle of obedience to God’s commands, our interest being
rightly understood; because this obedience, and the pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
our own chief interest, must be in every ease one and the
thing: yet it may be questioned, whether self-love, considered
merely as the desire of our own interest or happiness, can, from
its nature, be thus absolutely and uniformly coincident with the
will of God; any more than particular affections can:<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> coincident
in such sort, as not to be liable to be excited upon occasions and
in degrees, impossible to be gratified consistently with the constitution
of things, or the divine appointments. So that <em>habits</em> of
resignation may, upon this account, be requisite for all creatures:
habits, I say; which signify what is formed by use. However,
in general it is obvious that both self-love and particular affection
in human creatures considered only as passive feelings, distort
and rend the mind; and therefore stand in need of discipline.
Now denial of those particular affections, in a course of active
virtue and obedience to God’s will, has a tendency to moderate
them; and seems also to have a tendency to habituate the mind,
to be easy and satisfied with that degree of happiness which is
allotted us, <i>i.e.</i> to moderate self-love. But the proper discipline
for resignation is affliction. A right behavior under that trial;
recollecting ourselves so as to consider it in the view, in which
religion teaches us to consider it, as from the hand of God, receiving
it as what he appoints, or thinks proper to permit, in his
world and under his government; this will habituate the mind to
a dutiful submission. Such submission, together with the active
principle of obedience, make up the temper and character in us,
which answers to his sovereignty; and which absolutely belongs
to the condition of our being, as dependent creatures. Nor can
it be said, that this is only breaking the mind to a submission to
mere power; for mere power may be accidental, and precarious,
and usurped: but it is forming within ourselves the temper of
resignation to His rightful authority, who is, by nature, supreme
over all.</p>

<p>Upon the whole: such a character, and such qualifications, are
necessary for a mature state of life in the present world, as nature
alone does in no wise bestow; but has put it upon us, in great
part, to acquire, in our progress from one stage of life to another,
from childhood to mature age; put it upon us to acquire them,
by giving us capacities of doing it, and by placing us, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
beginning of life, in a condition fit for it. And this is a general
analogy to our condition in the present world, as in a state of
moral discipline for another.</p>

<p>It is in vain to object against the credibility of the present
life’s being intended for this purpose, that all the trouble and the
danger unavoidably accompanying such discipline, might have
been saved us, by our being made at once the creatures and the
characters, <em>which we were to be</em>. For we experience, that <em>what
we were to be</em>, was to be the effect of <em>what we would do</em>: and
that the general conduct of nature is, not to save us trouble or
danger, but to make us capable of going through them, and to
put it upon us to do so. Acquirements of our own, experience
and habits, are the <em>natural</em> supply to our deficiencies, and security
against our dangers: since it is as plainly natural to set ourselves
to acquire the qualifications, as the external things, which
we stand in need of. In particular, it is as plainly a general law
of nature, that we should with regard to our temporal interest,
form and cultivate practical principles within us, by attention,
use, and discipline, as any thing whatever is a natural law; chiefly
in the beginning of life, but also throughout the whole course of
it. The alternative is left to our choice: either to improve ourselves,
and better our condition; or, in default of such improvement,
to remain deficient and wretched. It is therefore perfectly
credible, from the analogy of nature, that the same may be our
case, with respect to the happiness of a future state, and the
qualifications necessary for it.</p>

<p>There is a third thing, which may seem implied in the present
world’s being a state of probation; that it is a <em>theatre of action</em>,
for the manifestation of persons’ characters, with respect to a
future one: not, to be sure, to an all-knowing Being, but to his
creation or part of it. This may, perhaps, be only a consequence
of our being in a state of probation in the other senses. However,
it is not impossible, that men’s showing and making manifest,
what is in their heart, what their real character is, may have
respect to a future life, in ways and manners with which we are
not acquainted: particularly it may be a means, (for the Author
of nature does not appear to do any thing without means,) of
their being disposed of suitably to their characters; and of its
being known to the creation, by way of example, that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
thus disposed of. But not to enter upon any conjectural account
of this; one may just mention, that the manifestation of persons’
characters contributes very much, in various ways, to the carrying
on a great part of that general course of nature, respecting mankind,
which comes under our observation at present. I shall
only add, that probation, in both these senses, as well as in that
treated of in the foregoing chapter, is implied in moral government;
since by persons’ behavior under it, their characters cannot
but be manifested, and if they behave well, improved.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE OPINION OF NECESSITY, CONSIDERED AS INFLUENCING
PRACTICE.</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the foregoing treatise it appears, that the condition
of mankind, considered as inhabitants of this world only,
and under the government of God which we experience, is greatly
analogous to our condition, as designed for another world, or as
under that farther government, which religion teaches us. If
therefore any assert, as a fatalist must, that the opinion of universal
necessity is reconcilable with the former; there immediately
arises a question in the way of analogy, whether he must not also
own it to be reconcilable with the latter, <i>i.e.</i> with the system of
religion itself, and the proof of it. The reader then will observe,
that the question now before us is not absolute, <i>i.e.</i> whether the
opinion of fate be reconcilable with religion; but hypothetical,
whether, upon supposition of its being reconcilable with the constitution
of nature, it be not reconcilable with religion also. Or,
what pretence a fatalist, not other persons, but a fatalist, has to
conclude from his opinion, that there can be no such thing as
religion. And as the puzzle and obscurity, which must unavoidably
arise from arguing upon so absurd a supposition as that of
universal necessity, will, I fear, easily be seen; it will, I hope, as
easily be excused.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Since it has been all along taken for granted, as a thing proved,
that there is an intelligent Author of nature, or natural Governor
of the world; and since an objection may be made against the
proof of this, from the opinion of universal necessity, as it may
be supposed, that such necessity will itself account for the origin
and preservation of all things; it is requisite, that this objection
be distinctly answered; or that it be shown, that a fatality supposed
consistent with what we certainly experience, does not
destroy the proof of an intelligent Author and Governor of
nature; before we proceed to consider, whether it destroys the
proof of a moral Governor of it, or of our being in a state of
religion.</p>

<p>When it is said by a fatalist, that the whole constitution of
nature, the actions of men, every thing, and every mode and
circumstance of every thing, is necessary, and could not possibly
have been otherwise; it is to be observed, that this necessity does
not exclude deliberation, choice, preference, and acting from certain
principles, and to certain ends: because all this is matter of
undoubted experience, acknowledged by all, and what every man
may, every moment, be conscious of. Hence it follows, that
necessity, alone and of itself, is in no sort an account of the constitution
of nature, and how things came <em>to be</em> and <em>to continue</em> as
they are; but only an account of this <em>circumstance</em> relating to
their origin and continuance, that they could not have been otherwise,
than they are and have been. The assertion, that every
thing is by necessity of nature, is not an answer to the question;
Whether the world came into being as it is, by an intelligent
Agent forming it thus, or not: but to quite another question;
Whether it came into being as it is, in that way and manner
which we call <em>necessarily</em>, or in that way and manner which we call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<em>freely</em>? For suppose farther, that one who was a fatalist, and
one who kept to his natural sense of things, and believed himself
a free agent, were disputing together, and vindicating their
respective opinions; and they should happen to instance a
house; they would agree that it was built by an architect. Their
difference concerning necessity and freedom would occasion no
difference of judgment concerning this; but only concerning another
matter; whether the architect built it necessarily or freely.</p>

<p>Suppose they should proceed to inquire concerning the constitution
of nature. In a lax way of speaking, one of them might
say, it was by necessity; and the other, by freedom: but if they
had any meaning to their words, as the latter must mean a free
agent, so the former must at length be reduced to mean an agent,
whether he would say one or more, acting by necessity: for abstract
notions can do nothing. We indeed ascribe to God a necessary
existence, uncaused by any agent. For we find within ourselves
the idea of infinity, <i>i.e.</i> immensity and eternity, impossible,
even in imagination, to be removed out of being. We seem to
discern intuitively, that there must, and cannot but be, something,
external to ourselves, answering this idea, or the archetype
of it. Hence, (for <em>this abstract</em>, as much as any other, implies
a <em>concrete</em>) we conclude, that there is, and cannot but be, an infinite
and immense eternal being, existing prior to all design contributing
to his existence, and exclusive of it. From the scantiness
of language, a manner of speaking has been introduced;
that necessity is the foundation, the reason, the account of the
existence of God. But it is not alleged, nor can it be at all
intended, that <em>every thing</em> exists as it does, by this kind of necessity:
a necessity antecedent in nature to design: it cannot, I
say, be meant that every thing exists as it does, by this kind of
necessity, upon several accounts; and particularly because it is
admitted, that design, in the actions of men, contributes to many
alterations in nature. If any deny this, I shall not pretend to
reason with them.</p>

<p>From these things it follows; <i>First</i>, That when a fatalist
asserts, that every thing is <em>by necessity</em>, he must mean, <em>by an
agent acting necessarily</em>; he <em>must</em>, I say, mean this, for I am
very sensible he would not choose to mean it. <i>Secondly</i>, That
the necessity, by which such an agent is supposed to act, does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
not exclude intelligence and design. So that, were the system
of fatality admitted, it would just as much account for the formation
of the world, as for the structure of a house, and no
more. Necessity as much requires and supposes a necessary
agent, as freedom requires and supposes a free agent, to be the
former of the world. And the appearances of <em>design</em> and of <em>final
causes</em> in the constitution of nature as really prove this acting
agent to be an <em>intelligent designer</em>, or to act from choice; upon
the scheme of necessity, supposed possible, as upon that of
freedom.</p>

<p>It appearing thus, that the notion of necessity does not destroy
the proof that there is an intelligent Author of nature and
natural Governor of the world; the present question, which the
analogy before mentioned suggests,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and which, I think, it will
answer, is this: Whether the opinion of necessity, supposed consistent
with possibility, with the constitution of the world, and
the natural government which we experience exercised over it,
destroys all reasonable ground of belief, that we are in a state of
religion: or whether that opinion be reconcilable with religion;
with the system, and the proof of it.</p>

<p>Suppose then a fatalist to educate any one, from his youth up,
in his own principles; that the child should reason upon them,
and conclude, that since he cannot possibly behave otherwise
than he does, he is not a subject of blame or commendation, nor
can deserve to be rewarded or punished. Imagine him to eradicate
the very perceptions of blame and commendation out of his
mind, by means of this system; to form his temper, and character,
and behavior to it; and from it to judge of the treatment
he was to expect, say, from reasonable men, upon his coming
abroad into the world: as the fatalist judges from this system,
what he is to expect from the Author of nature, and with regard
to a future state. I cannot forbear stopping here to ask, whether
any one of common sense would think fit, that a child should be
put upon these speculations, and be left to apply them to practice.
And a man has little pretence to reason, who is not
sensible, that we are all children in speculations of this kind.
However, the child would doubtless be highly delighted to find
himself freed from the restraints of fear and shame, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
his play-fellows were fettered and embarrassed; and highly conceited
in his superior knowledge, so far beyond his years. But
conceit and vanity would be the least bad part of the influence,
which these principles must have, when thus reasoned and acted
upon, during the course of his education. He must either be
allowed to go on and be the plague of all about him, and himself
too, even to his own destruction, or else correction must be continually
made use of, to supply the want of those natural perceptions
of blame and commendation, which we have supposed to
be removed; and to give him a practical impression, of what he
had reasoned himself out of the belief of, that he was in fact an
accountable child, and to be punished for doing what he was
forbid. It is therefore in reality impossible, but that the correction
which he must meet with, in the course of his education,
must convince him, that if the scheme he was instructed in were
not false, yet that he reasoned inconclusively upon it, and somehow
or other misapplied it to practice and common life; as what
the fatalist experiences of the conduct of Providence at present,
ought in all reason to convince him, that this scheme is misapplied,
when applied to the subject of religion.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> But supposing
the child’s temper could remain still formed to the system, and
his expectation of the treatment he was to have in the world, be
regulated by it; so as to expect that no reasonable man would
blame or punish him, for any thing which he should do, because
he could not help doing it: upon this supposition it is manifest
he would, upon his coming abroad into the world, be insupportable
to society, and the treatment which he would receive from it
would render it so to him; and he could not fail of doing something
very soon, for which he would be delivered over into the
hands of civil justice. And thus, in the end, he would be convinced
of the obligations he was under to his wise instructor.</p>

<p>Suppose this scheme of fatality, in any other way, applied to
practice, such practical application of it will be found equally
absurd; equally fallacious in a practical sense. For instance, that
if a man be destined to live such a time, he shall live to it,
though he take no care of his own preservation; or if he be
destined to die before that time, no care can prevent it, therefore
all care about preserving one’s life is to be neglected: which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
is the fallacy instanced in by the ancients. On the contrary,
none of these practical absurdities can be drawn from reasoning,
upon the supposition that we are free; but all such reasoning
with regard to the common affairs of life is justified by experience.
Therefore, though it were admitted that this opinion of necessity
were <em>speculatively</em> true; yet, with regard to practice, it is as if it
were false, so far as our experience reaches: that is, to the whole
of our present life. For, the constitution of the present world,
and the condition in which we are actually placed, is, as if we
were free. And it may perhaps justly be concluded, that since
the whole process of action, through every step of it, suspense,
deliberation, inclining one way, determining, and at last doing as
we determine, is as if we were free, therefore we are so.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The thing here insisted upon is, that under the present natural
government of the world, we find we are treated and dealt with,
as if we were free, prior to all consideration whether we are so or
not. Were this opinion therefore of necessity admitted to be
ever so true; yet such is in fact our condition and the natural
course of things, that whenever we apply it to life and practice,
this application of it always misleads us, and cannot but mislead
us, in a most dreadful manner, with regard to our present interest.
How then can people think themselves so very secure, that the
same application of the same opinion may not mislead them also,
in some analogous manner, with respect to a future, a more
general, and more important interest? For, religion being a
practical subject; and the analogy of nature showing us, that we
have not faculties to apply this opinion, were it a true one, to
practical subjects; whenever we do apply it to the subject of religion,
and thence conclude, that we are free from its obligations,
it is plain this conclusion cannot be depended upon. There will
still remain just reason to think, whatever appearances are, that
we deceive ourselves; in somewhat of a like manner, as when
people fancy they can draw contradictory conclusions from the
idea of infinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>From these things together, the attentive reader will see it
follows, that if upon supposition of freedom the evidence of religion
be conclusive, it remains so, upon supposition of necessity,
because the notion of necessity is not applicable to practical subjects:
<i>i.e.</i> with respect to them, is as if it were not true. Nor
does this contain any reflection upon reason, but only upon what
is unreasonable. For to pretend to act upon reason, in opposition
to practical principles, which the Author of our nature gave us to
act upon; and to pretend to apply our reason to subjects, with
regard to which, our own short views, and even our experience,
will show us, it cannot be depended upon; and such, at best, the
subject of necessity must be; this is vanity, conceit, and unreasonableness.</p>

<p>But this is not all. We find within ourselves a will, and are
conscious of a character. Now if this, in us, be reconcilable with
fate, it is reconcilable with it in the Author of nature. Besides,
natural government and final causes imply a character and a will
in the Governor and Designer;<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> a will concerning the creatures
whom he governs. The Author of nature then being certainly
of some character or other, notwithstanding necessity; it is evident
this necessity is as reconcilable with the particular character
of benevolence, veracity, and justice, in him, which attributes
are the foundation of religion, as with any other character: since
we find this necessity no more hinders <em>men</em> from being benevolent,
than cruel; true, than faithless; just, than unjust; or, if
the fatalist pleases, what we call unjust. It is said indeed, that
what, upon supposition of freedom, would be just punishment,
upon supposition of necessity, becomes manifestly unjust: because
it is punishment inflicted for doing that which persons could not
avoid doing. As if the necessity, which is supposed to destroy
the injustice of murder, for instance, would not also destroy the
injustice of punishing it! However, as little to the purpose as
this objection is in itself, it is very much to the purpose to observe
from it, how the notions of justice and injustice remain,
even while we endeavor to suppose them removed; how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
force themselves upon the mind, even while we are making suppositions
destructive of them: for there is not, perhaps, a man in
the world, but would be ready to make this objection at first
thought.</p>

<p>But though it is most evident, that universal necessity, if it be
reconcilable with any thing, is reconcilable with that character in
the Author of nature, which is the foundation of religion; “Yet,
does it not plainly destroy the <em>proof</em> that he is of that character,
and consequently the proof of religion?” By no means. For
we find, that happiness and misery are not our <em>fate</em>, in any such
sense as not to be the consequences of our behavior; but that
they are the consequences of it.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> We find God exercises the
same kind of government over us, which a father exercises over
his children, and a civil magistrate over his subjects. Now,
whatever becomes of abstract questions concerning liberty and
necessity, it evidently appears to us, that veracity and justice
must be the natural rule and measure of exercising this authority
or government, to a Being who can have no competitions, or interfering
of interests, with his creatures and his subjects.</p>

<p>But as the doctrine of liberty, though we experience its truth,
may be perplexed with difficulties, which run up into the most
abstruse of all speculations; and as the opinion of necessity seems
to be the very basis upon which infidelity grounds itself; it may
be of some use to offer a more particular proof of the obligations
of religion, which may distinctly be shown not to be destroyed
by this opinion.</p>

<p>The proof from final causes of an intelligent Author of nature
is not affected by the opinion of necessity; supposing necessity a
thing possible in itself, and reconcilable with the constitution of
things.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> It is a matter of fact, independent on this or any other
speculation, that he governs the world by the method of rewards
and punishments:<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and also that he hath given us a moral faculty,
by which we distinguish between actions, and approve some as
virtuous and of good desert, and disapprove others as vicious and
of ill desert.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> This moral discernment implies, in the notion of
it, a rule of action, and a rule of a very peculiar kind: for it
carries in it authority and a right of direction; authority in such
a sense, as that we cannot depart from it without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
self-condemned.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> And that the dictates of this moral faculty, which are
by nature a rule to us, are moreover the laws of God, laws in a
sense including sanctions; may be thus proved. Consciousness
of a rule or guide of action, in creatures who are capable of considering
it as given them by their Maker, not only raises immediately
a sense of duty, but also a sense of security in following
it, and of danger in deviating from it. A direction of the Author
of nature, given to creatures capable of looking upon it as such,
is plainly a command from him: and a command from him necessarily
includes in it, at least, an implicit promise in case of obedience,
or threatening in case of disobedience. But then the
sense or perception of good and ill desert,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> which is contained in
the moral discernment, renders the sanction explicit, and makes
it appear, as one may say, expressed. For since his method of
government is to reward and punish actions, his having annexed
to some actions an inseparable sense of good desert, and to others
of ill, this surely amounts to declaring, upon whom his punishments
shall be inflicted, and his rewards be bestowed. He must
have given us this discernment and sense of things, as a presentiment
of what is to be hereafter: that is, by way of information
beforehand, what we are finally to expect in this world. There
is then most evident ground to think, that the government of
God, upon the whole, will be found to correspond to the nature
which he has given us: and that, in the upshot and issue of
things, happiness and misery shall, in fact and event, be made
to follow virtue and vice respectively; as he has already, in so
peculiar a manner, associated the ideas of them in our minds.
And hence might easily be deduced the obligations of religious
worship, were it only to be considered as a means of preserving
upon our minds a sense of this moral government of God, and
securing our obedience to it: which yet is an extremely imperfect
view of that most important duty.</p>

<p>No objection from necessity can lie against this general proof
of religion. None against the proposition reasoned upon, that
we have such a moral faculty and discernment; because this is a
mere matter of fact, a thing of experience, that human kind is
thus constituted: none against the conclusion; because it is
immediate and wholly from this fact. For the conclusion, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
God will finally reward the righteous and punish the wicked, is
not here drawn, from its appearing to us fit<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> that <em>he should</em>; but
from its appearing, that he has told us, <em>he will</em>. And this he
hath certainly told us, in the promise and threatening, which it
hath been observed the notion of a command implies, and the
sense of good and ill desert which he has given us, more distinctly
expresses. This reasoning from fact is confirmed, and in
some degree even verified, by other facts; by the natural tendencies
of virtue and of vice;<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and by this, that God, in the natural
course of his providence, punishes vicious actions as mischievous
to society; and also vicious actions as such in the strictest sense.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
So that the general proof of religion is unanswerably real, even
upon the wild supposition which we are arguing upon.</p>

<p>It must be observed further, that natural religion has, besides
this, an external evidence; which the doctrine of necessity, if it
could be true, would not affect. For suppose a person, by the
observations and reasoning above, or by any other, convinced of
the truth of religion; that there is a God, who made the world,
who is the moral governor and judge of mankind, and will upon
the whole deal with every one according to his works: I say,
suppose a person convinced of this by reason, but to know
nothing at all of antiquity, or the present state of mankind: it
would be natural for such a one to be inquisitive, what was the
history of this system of doctrine; at what time, and in what
manner, it came first into the world; and whether it were believed
by any considerable part of it. Were he upon inquiry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
find, that a particular person, in a late age, first of all proposed
it, as a deduction of reason, and that mankind were before
wholly ignorant of it; then, though its evidence from reason
would remain, there would be no additional probability of its
truth, from the account of its discovery.</p>

<p>But instead of this being the fact, he would find, on the contrary,
what could not but afford him a very strong confirmation
of its truth: <i>First</i>, That somewhat of this system, with more or
fewer additions and alterations, hath been professed in all ages
and countries, of which we have any certain information relating
to this matter. <i>Secondly</i>, That it is certain historical fact, so
far as we can trace things up, that this whole system of belief,
that there is one God, the creator and moral governor of the
world, and that mankind is in a state of religion, was received
in the first ages. And <i>Thirdly</i>, That as there is no hint or intimation
in history, that this system was first reasoned out; so
there is express historical or traditional evidence, as ancient as
history, that it was taught first by revelation.</p>

<p>Now these things must be allowed to be of great weight. The
first of them, general consent, shows this system to be conformable
to the common sense of mankind. The second, namely,
that religion was believed in the first ages of the world, especially
as it does not appear that there were then any superstitious or
false additions to it, cannot but be a further confirmation of its
truth. For it is a proof of this alternative: either that it came
into the world by revelation; or that it is natural, obvious, and
forces itself upon the mind. The former of these is the conclusion
of learned men. And whoever will consider, how unapt for
speculation rude and uncultivated minds are, will, perhaps from
hence alone, be strongly inclined to believe it the truth. And
as it is shown in the second part<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> of this treatise, that there is
nothing of such peculiar presumption against a revelation in the
beginning of the world, as there is supposed to be against subsequent
ones; a sceptic could not, I think, give any account, which
would appear more probable even to himself, of the early pretences
to revelation; than by supposing some real original one,
from whence they were copied.</p>

<p>And the third thing above mentioned, that there is express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
historical or traditional evidence, as ancient as history, of the
system of religion being taught mankind by revelation, this must
be admitted as some degree of real proof, that it was so taught.
For why should not the most ancient tradition be admitted as
some additional proof of a fact, against which there is no presumption?
This proof is mentioned here, because it has its
weight to show, that religion came into the world by revelation,
prior to all consideration of the proper authority of any book
supposed to contain it; and even prior to all consideration,
whether the revelation itself be uncorruptly handed down, or
mixed and darkened with fables. Thus the historical account,
which we have of the origin of religion, taking in all circumstances,
is a real confirmation of its truth, no way affected by
the opinion of necessity. And the <em>external</em> evidence, even of
natural religion, is by no means inconsiderable.</p>

<p>It is carefully to be observed, and ought to be recollected after
all proofs of virtue and religion, which are only general, that as
speculative reason may be neglected, prejudiced, and deceived,
so also may our moral understanding be impaired and perverted,
and the dictates of it not impartially attended to. This indeed
proves nothing against the reality of our speculative or practical
faculties of perception? against their being intended by nature,
to inform us in the theory of things, and instruct us how we are
to behave, and what we are to expect in consequence of our
behavior. Yet our liableness, in the degree we are liable, to
prejudice and perversion, is a most serious admonition to us to be
upon our guard, with respect to what is of such consequence, as
our determinations concerning virtue and religion; and particularly
not to take custom, and fashion, and slight notions of
honor, or imaginations of present ease, use, and convenience to
mankind, for the only moral rule.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing observations, drawn from the nature of the
thing, and the history of religion, amount, <em>when taken together</em>,
to a real practical proof of it, not to be confuted: such a proof
as, considering the infinite importance of the thing, I apprehend,
would be admitted fully sufficient, in reason, to influence the
actions of men, who act upon thought and reflection, if it were admitted
that there is no proof of the contrary. But it may be said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
“There are many probabilities, which cannot indeed be confuted;
<i>i.e.</i> shown to be no probabilities, and yet may be overbalanced by
greater probabilities, on the other side; much more by demonstration.
And there is no occasion to object against particular
arguments alleged for an opinion, when the opinion itself may be
clearly shown to be false, without meddling with such arguments
at all, but leaving them just as they are.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Now the method of
government by rewards and punishments, and especially rewarding
and punishing good and ill desert as such respectively, must
go upon supposition, that we are free and not necessary agents.
And it is incredible, that the Author of nature should govern us
upon a supposition as true, which he knows to be false; and
therefore absurd to think, he will reward or punish us for our
actions hereafter; especially that he will do it under the notion,
that they are of good or ill desert.”</p>

<p>Here then the matter is brought to a point. And the answer
is full, and not to be evaded,&mdash;viz.: that the whole constitution
and course of things, the whole analogy of Providence, shows
beyond possibility of doubt, that the conclusion from this reasoning
is false; wherever the fallacy lies. The doctrine of freedom
indeed clearly shows where: in supposing ourselves necessary,
when in truth we are free agents. But, upon the supposition of
necessity, the fallacy lies in taking for granted, that it is incredible
necessary agents should be rewarded and punished.
That, somehow or other, the conclusion now mentioned is false,
is most certain. For it is fact, that God does govern even brute
creatures by the method of rewards and punishments, in the
natural course of things. Men are rewarded and punished for
their actions, punished for actions mischievous to society as being
so, punished for vicious actions as such; by the natural instrumentality
of each other, under the present conduct of Providence.
Nay, even the affection of gratitude, and the passion of
resentment, and the rewards and punishments following from
them, which in general are to be considered as natural, <i>i.e.</i> from
the Author of nature; these rewards and punishments, being
<em>naturally</em><a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> annexed to actions considered as implying good intention
and good desert, ill intention and ill desert; these natural
rewards and punishments, I say, are as much a contradiction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the conclusion above, and show its falsehood, as a more exact and
complete rewarding and punishing of good and ill desert as such.
So that if it be incredible, that necessary agents should be thus
rewarded and punished; then, men are not necessary but free;
since it is matter of fact, that they are thus rewarded and
punished. If, on the contrary, which is the supposition we have
been arguing upon, it be insisted that men are necessary agents;
then, there is nothing incredible in the further supposition of
necessary agents being thus rewarded and punished: since we
ourselves are thus dealt with.</p>

<p>From the whole therefore it must follow, that a necessity supposed
possible, and reconcilable with the constitution of things,
does in no sort prove that the Author of Nature will not, nor
destroy the proof that he will, finally and upon the whole, in his
eternal government, render his creatures happy or miserable, by
some means or other, as they behave well or ill. Or, to express
this conclusion in words conformable to the title of the chapter,
the analogy of nature shows us, that the opinion of necessity, considered
as practical, is false. And if necessity, upon the supposition
above mentioned, doth not destroy the proof of natural
religion, it evidently makes no alteration in the proof of revealed.</p>

<p>From these things likewise we may learn, in what sense to
understand that general assertion, that the opinion of necessity is
essentially destructive of all religion. First, in a practical sense;
that by this notion, atheistical men pretend to satisfy and encourage
themselves in vice, and justify to others their disregard to
all religion. And secondly, in the strictest sense; that it is a
contradiction to the whole constitution of nature, and to what we
may every moment experience in ourselves, and so overturns
every thing. But by no means is this assertion to be understood,
as if necessity, supposing it could possibly be reconciled with the
constitution of things, and with what we experience, were not
also reconcilable with religion: for upon this supposition, it
demonstrably is so.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD, CONSIDERED AS A SCHEME OR
CONSTITUTION, IMPERFECTLY COMPREHENDED.</span></h3>

<p>Though it be acknowledged, as it cannot but be, that the analogy
of nature gives a strong credibility to the general doctrine of
religion, and to the several particular things contained in it, considered
as so many matters of fact; and likewise that it shows
this credibility not to be destroyed by any notions of necessity:
still, objections may be insisted upon, against the wisdom, equity,
and goodness of the divine government implied in the notion of
religion, and against the method by which this government is
conducted; to which objections analogy can be no direct answer.
For the credibility, or the certain truth, of a matter of fact, does
not immediately prove any thing concerning the wisdom or goodness
of it; and analogy can do no more, immediately or directly,
than show such and such things to be true or credible, considered
only as matters of fact. But if, upon supposition of a moral constitution
of nature and a moral government over it, analogy suggests
and makes it credible, that this government must be a
scheme, system, or constitution of government, as distinguished
from a number of single unconnected acts of distributive justice
and goodness; and likewise, that it must be a scheme, so imperfectly
comprehended, and of such a sort in other respects, as to
afford a direct general answer to all objections against the justice
and goodness of it: then analogy is, remotely, of great service in
answering those objections; both by suggesting the answer, and
showing it to be a credible one.</p>

<p>Now this, upon inquiry, will be found to be the case. For,
<i>First</i>, Upon supposition that God exercises a moral government
over the world, the analogy of his natural government suggests
and makes it credible, that his moral government <em>must</em> be a
scheme, quite beyond our comprehension: and this affords a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
general answer to all objections against the justice and goodness
of it. <i>Secondly</i>, A more distinct observation of some particular
things contained in God’s scheme of natural government, the like
things being supposed, by analogy, to be contained in his moral
government, will further show, how little weight is to be laid
upon these objections.</p>

<p>I. Upon supposition that God exercises a moral government
over the world, the analogy of his natural government suggests
and makes it credible, that his moral government must be a
scheme, quite beyond our comprehension; and this affords a
general answer to all objections against the justice and goodness
of it. It is most obvious, analogy renders it highly credible, that,
upon supposition of a moral government, it must be a scheme.
For the world, and the whole natural government of it, appears
to be so: to be a scheme, system, or constitution, whose parts
correspond to each other, and to a whole, as really as any work of
art, or as any particular model of a civil constitution and government.
In this great scheme of the natural world, individuals
have various peculiar relations to other individuals of their own
species. Whole species are, we find, variously related to other
species, upon this earth. Nor do we know, how much further
these kinds of relations may extend. And, as there is not any
action or natural event, which we are acquainted with, so single
and unconnected, as not to have a respect to some other actions
and events; so possibly each of them, when it has not an immediate,
may yet have a remote, natural relation to other actions
and events, much beyond the compass of this present world.
There seems indeed nothing, from whence we can so much as
make a conjecture, whether all creatures, actions, and events,
throughout the whole of nature, have relations to each other
But, as it is obvious, that all events have future unknown consequences;
so if we trace any event, as far as we can, into what is
connected with it, we shall find, that if it were not connected
with something further in nature, unknown to us, something
both past and present, such event could not possibly have been
at all. Nor can we give the whole account of any one thing
whatever; of all its causes, ends, and necessary adjuncts; those
adjuncts, I mean, without which it could not have been. By
this most astonishing connection, these reciprocal correspondences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and mutual relations, every thing which we see in the course of
nature is actually brought about. Things seemingly the most
insignificant imaginable, are perpetually observed to be necessary
conditions to other things of the greatest importance; so that
any one thing whatever, may for aught we know to the contrary,
be a necessary condition to any other.</p>

<p>The natural world then, and natural government of it, being
such an incomprehensible scheme; so incomprehensible, that a
man must, really in the literal sense, know nothing at all, who is
not sensible of his ignorance in it; this immediately suggests,
and strongly shows the credibility, that the moral world and
government of it may be so too.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Indeed the natural and moral
constitution and government of the world are so connected, as to
make up together but one scheme: and it is highly probable,
that the first is formed and carried on merely in subserviency to
the latter; as the vegetable world is for the animal, and organized
bodies for minds. But the thing intended here is, without inquiring
how far the administration of the natural world is subordinate
to that of the moral, only to observe the credibility, that
one should be analogous or similar to the other: that therefore
every act of divine justice and goodness may be supposed to look
much beyond itself, and its immediate object; may have some
reference to other parts of God’s moral administration, and to a
general moral plan; and that every circumstance of this his moral
government may be adjusted beforehand with a view to the whole
of it. For example: the determined length of time, and the
degrees and ways, in which virtue is to remain in a state of warfare
and discipline, and in which wickedness is permitted to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
its progress; the times appointed for the execution of justice;
the appointed instruments of it; the kinds of rewards and punishments,
and the manners of their distribution; all particular instances
of divine justice and goodness, and every circumstance of
them, may have such respects to each other, as to make up altogether
a whole, connected and related in all its parts; a scheme
or system, which is as properly such, as the natural world is, and
of the like kind. Supposing this to be the case, it is most evident,
that we are not competent judges of this scheme, from the
small parts of it which come within our view in the present life:
therefore no objections against any of these parts can be insisted
upon by reasonable men.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>This our ignorance, and the consequence here drawn from it,
are universally acknowledged upon <em>other</em> occasions; and though
scarce denied, yet are universally forgot, when persons come to
argue against religion. And it is not perhaps easy, even for the
most reasonable men, always to bear in mind the degree of our
ignorance, and make due allowances for it. Upon these accounts,
it may not be useless to go a little further, in order to show more
distinctly, how just an answer our ignorance is, to objections
against the scheme of Providence. Suppose then a person boldly
to assert,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> that the things complained of, the origin and continuance
of evil, might easily have been prevented by repeated interpositions;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
interpositions so guarded and circumstanced, as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
preclude all mischief arising from them. Or, if this were impracticable,
that a <em>scheme</em> of government is itself an imperfection,
since more good might have been produced, without any scheme,
system, or constitution at all, by continued single unrelated acts
of distributive justice and goodness; because these would have
occasioned no irregularities. Farther than this, it is presumed,
the objections will not be carried. Yet the answer is obvious:
that were these assertions true, still the observations above, concerning
our ignorance in the scheme of divine government and
the consequence drawn from it, would hold, in great measure;
enough to vindicate religion, against all objections from the disorders
of the present state. Were these assertions true, yet the
government of the world might be just and good notwithstanding;
for, at the most, they would infer nothing more than that it
might have been better. But they are mere arbitrary assertions;
no man being sufficiently acquainted with the possibilities of
things, to bring any proof of them to the lowest degree of probability.
For however possible what is asserted may seem, yet
many instances may be alleged, in things much less out of our
reach, of suppositions absolutely impossible, and reducible to the
most palpable self contradictions, which, not every one would perceive
to be such; nor perhaps any one, at first sight suspect.</p>

<p>From these things, it is easy to see distinctly, how our ignorance,
as it is the common, so it is really a satisfactory answer,
to all objections against the justice and goodness of Providence.
If a man, contemplating any one providential dispensation, which
had no relation to any others, should object, that he discerned in
it a disregard to justice, or a deficiency of goodness; nothing
would be less an answer to such objection, than our ignorance in
other parts of providence, or in the possibilities of things, no way
related to what he was contemplating. But when we know not
but the part objected against may be relative to other parts unknown
to us; and when we are unacquainted with what is, in
the nature of the thing, practicable in the case before us; then
our ignorance is a satisfactory answer; because, some unknown
relation, or some unknown impossibility, may render what is
objected against, just and good; nay good in the highest practicable
degree.</p>

<p>II. How little weight is to be laid upon such objections, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
further appear, by a more distinct observation of some particular
things contained in the natural government of God, the like to
which may be supposed, from analogy, to be contained in his
moral government.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, As in the scheme of the natural world, no ends appear
to be accomplished without means: so we find that means very
undesirable, often conduce to bring about ends in such a measure
desirable, as greatly to overbalance the disagreeableness of the
means. And in cases where such means are conducive to such
ends, it is not reason, but <em>experience</em>, which shows us, that they
are thus conducive. Experience also shows many means to be
conducive and necessary to accomplish ends, which means, before
experience, we should have thought, would have had even a contrary
tendency. From these observations relating to the natural
scheme of the world, the moral being supposed analogous to it,
arises a great credibility, that the putting our misery in each
other’s power to the degree it is, and making men liable to vice
to the degree we are; and in general, that those things which
are objected against the moral scheme of Providence, may be,
upon the whole, friendly and assistant to virtue, and productive
of an overbalance of happiness: <i>i.e.</i> the things objected against
may be means, by which an overbalance of good, will in the end,
be found produced. And from the same observations, it appears
to be no presumption against this, that we do not, if indeed we
do not, see those means to have any such tendency, or that they
seem to us to have a contrary one. Thus those things, which we
call irregularities, may not be so at all; because they may be
means of accomplishing wise and good ends more considerable.
It may be added, as above, that they may also be the only means,
by which these wise and good ends are capable of being accomplished.</p>

<p>It may be proper to add, in order to obviate an absurd and
wicked conclusion from any of these observations, that though
the constitution of our nature, from whence we are capable of
vice and misery, may, as it undoubtedly does, contribute to the
perfection and happiness of the world; and though the actual
permission of evil may be beneficial to it: (<i>i.e.</i> it would have
been more mischievous, not that a wicked person had himself
abstained from his own wickedness, but that any one had forcibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
prevented it, than that it was permitted:) yet notwithstanding,
it might have been much better for the world, if this very evil
had never been done. Nay it is most clearly conceivable, that
the very commission of wickedness may be beneficial to the world,
and yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain
from it. For thus, in the wise and good constitution of the
natural world, there are disorders which bring their own cures;
diseases, which are themselves remedies. Many a man would
have died, had it not been for the gout or a fever; yet it would
be thought madness to assert, that sickness is a better or more
perfect state than health; though the like, with regard to the
moral world, has been asserted.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, The natural government of the world is carried on
by general laws. For this there may be wise and good reasons:
the wisest and best, for aught we know to the contrary. And
that there are such reasons, is suggested to our thoughts by the
analogy of nature; by our being made to experience good ends
to be accomplished, as indeed all the good which we enjoy is
accomplished, by this means,&mdash;viz.: that the laws, by which the
world is governed, are general. We have scarce any kind of
enjoyments, but what we are, in some way or other, instrumental
in procuring ourselves, by acting in a manner which we <em>foresee</em>
likely to procure them: now this foresight could not be at all,
were not the government of the world carried on by general laws.
And though, for aught we know to the contrary, every single
case may be, at length, found to have been provided for even by
these: yet to prevent all irregularities, or remedy them as they
arise, by the wisest and best general laws, may be impossible in
the nature of things; as we see it is absolutely impossible in civil
government.</p>

<p>But then we are ready to think, that, the constitution of nature
remaining as it is, and the course of things being permitted to go
on, in other respects, as it does, there might be interpositions to
prevent irregularities; though they could not have been prevented,
or remedied by any general laws. There would indeed
be reason to wish, which, by-the-way, is very different from a
right to claim, that all irregularities were prevented or remedied
by present interpositions, if these interpositions would have no
other effect than this. But it is plain they would have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
visible and immediate <em>bad</em> effects: for instance, they would
encourage idleness and negligence; and they would render
doubtful the natural rule of life, which is ascertained by this
very thing, that the course of the world is carried on by general
laws. And further, it is certain they would have <em>distant</em> effects,
and very great ones too; by means of the wonderful connections
before mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> So that we cannot so much as guess, what
would be the whole result of the interpositions desired. It may
be said, any bad result might be prevented by further interpositions,
whenever there was occasion for them: but this again is
talking quite at random, and in the dark.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Upon the whole then, we see wise reasons, why the course of
the world should be carried on by general laws, and good ends
accomplished by this means: and for aught we know, there
may be the wisest reasons for it, and the best ends accomplished
by it. We have no ground to believe, that all irregularities could
be remedied as they arise, or could have been precluded, by general
laws. We find that interpositions would produce evil, and
prevent good: and, for aught we know, they would produce
greater evil than they would prevent; and prevent greater good
than they would produce. And if this be the case, then the not
interposing is so far from being a ground of complaint, that it is
an instance of goodness. This is intelligible and sufficient: and
going further, seems beyond the utmost reach of our faculties.</p>

<p>It may be said, that “after all, these supposed impossibilities
and relations are what we are unacquainted with; and we must
judge of religion, as of other things, by what we do know, and
look upon the rest as nothing: or however, that the answers here
given to what is objected against religion, may equally be made
use of to invalidate the proof of it; since their stress lies so
very much upon our ignorance.” But,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Though total ignorance in any matter does indeed
equally destroy, or rather preclude, all proof concerning it, and
objections against it; yet partial ignorance does not. For we
may in any degree be convinced, that a person is of such a character,
and consequently will pursue such ends; though we are
greatly ignorant, what is the proper way of acting, in order the
most effectually to obtain those ends: and in this case, objections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
against his manner of acting, as seemingly not conducive to obtain
them, might be answered by our ignorance; though the
proof that such ends were intended, might not at all be invalidated
by it. Thus, the proof of religion is a proof of the moral
character of God, and consequently that his government is moral,
and that every one upon the whole shall receive according to his
deserts; a proof that this is the designed end of his government.
But we are not competent judges, what is the proper way of
acting, in order the most effectually to accomplish this end.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Therefore our ignorance is an answer to objections against the
conduct of Providence, in permitting irregularities, as seeming
contradictory to this end. Now, since it is so obvious, that our
ignorance may be a satisfactory answer to objections against a
thing, and yet not affect the proof of it; till it can be shown, it
is frivolous to assert, that our ignorance invalidates the proof of
religion, as it does the objections against it.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Suppose unknown impossibilities, and unknown relations,
might justly be urged to invalidate the proof of religion,
as well as to answer objections against it; and that, in consequence
of this, the proof of it were doubtful. Still, let the
assertion be despised, or let it be ridiculed, it is undeniably true,
that moral obligations would remain certain, though it were not
certain what would, upon the whole, be the consequences of
observing or violating them. For, these obligations arise, immediately
and necessarily, from the judgment of our own mind,
unless perverted, which we cannot violate without being self-condemned.
And they would be certain too, from considerations
of interest. For though it were doubtful, what will be the future
consequences of virtue and vice; yet it is, however, credible,
that they may have those consequences, which religion teaches
us they will: and this credibility is a certain<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> obligation in point
of prudence, to abstain from all wickedness, and to live in the
conscientious practice of all that is good.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, The answers above given to the objections against
religion cannot be made use of to invalidate the proof of it.
For, upon suspicion that God exercises a moral government over
the world, analogy does most strongly lead us to conclude, that
this moral government must be a scheme, or constitution, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
our comprehension. A thousand particular analogies show us,
that parts of such a scheme, from their relation to other parts,
may conduce to accomplish ends, which we should have thought
they had no tendency to accomplish: nay ends, which before experience,
we should have thought such parts were contradictory
to, and had a tendency to prevent. Therefore all these analogies
show, that the way of arguing made use of in objecting against
religion is delusive: because they show it is not at all incredible,
that, could we comprehend the whole, we should find the permission
of the disorders objected against to be consistent with
justice and goodness; and even to be instances of them. Now
this is not applicable to the proof of religion, as it is to the
objections against it;<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and therefore cannot invalidate that proof,
as it does these objections.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, From the observation now made, it is easy to see, that
the answers above given to the objections against Providence,
though, in a general way of speaking, they may be said to be
taken from our ignorance; yet are by no means taken merely
from that, but from something which analogy shows us concerning
it. For analogy shows us positively, that our ignorance in
the possibilities of things, and the various relations in nature,
renders us incompetent judges, and leads us to false conclusions,
in cases similar to this, in which we pretend to judge and to
object. So that the things above insisted upon are not mere
suppositions of unknown impossibilities and relations: but they
are suggested to our thoughts, and even forced upon the observation
of serious men, and rendered credible too, by the analogy of
nature. Therefore to take these things into the account, is to
judge by experience and what we do know: and it is not judging
so, to take no notice of them.</p>

<h3 id="I_CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>The observations of the last chapter lead us to consider this
little scene of human life, in which we are so busily engaged, as
having a reference, of some sort or other, to a much larger plan
of things. Whether we are, any way, related to the more distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
parts of the boundless universe, into which we are brought,
is altogether uncertain. But it is evident, that the course of
things, which comes within our view, is connected with some
things, past, present, and future, beyond it.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> So that we are
placed, as one may speak, in the middle of a scheme, not fixed
but progressive, every way incomprehensible: incomprehensible,
in a manner equally, with respect to what has been, what now is,
and what shall be. This scheme cannot but contain in it some
things as wonderful, and as much beyond our thought and conception,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
as any thing in that of religion. For, will any man in
his senses say, that it is less difficult to conceive, how the world
came to be and to continue as it is, without, than with, an intelligent
Author and Governor of it? Or, admitting an intelligent
Governor of it, that there is some other rule of government more
natural, and of easier conception, than that which we call moral?
Indeed, without an intelligent Author and Governor of nature,
no account at all can be given, how this universe, or the part of
it particularly in which we are concerned, came to be, and the
course of it to be carried on, as it is: nor any, of its general end
and design, without a moral governor of it. That there is an
intelligent Author of nature, and natural Governor of the world,
is a principle gone upon in the foregoing treatise; as proved, and
generally known, and confessed to be proved. And the very
notion of an intelligent Author of nature, proved by particular
final causes, implies a will and a character.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Now, as our whole nature, the nature which he has given us,
leads us to conclude his will and character to be moral, just, and
good: so we can scarce in imagination conceive, what it can be
otherwise. However, in consequence of this his will and character,
whatever it be, he formed the universe as it is, and carries
on the course of it as he does, rather than in any other manner;
and has assigned to us, and to all living creatures, a part and a
lot in it. Irrational creatures act this their part, and enjoy and
undergo the pleasures and the pains allotted them, without any
reflection. But one would think it impossible, that creatures
endued with reason could avoid reflecting sometimes upon all
this; reflecting, if not from whence we came, yet, at least,
whither we are going; and what the mysterious scheme, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
midst of which we find ourselves, will, at length, come out and
produce: a scheme in which it is certain we are highly interested,
and in which we may be interested even beyond conception.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>For many things prove it palpably absurd to conclude, that
we shall cease to be, at death. Particular analogies do most
sensibly show us, that there is nothing to be thought strange, in
our being to exist in another state of life. And that we are now
living beings, affords a strong probability that we shall <em>continue</em>
so; unless there be some positive ground, and there is none from
reason or analogy, to think death will destroy us. Were a persuasion
of this kind ever so well grounded, there would, surely,
be little reason to take pleasure in it. Indeed it can have no
other ground, than some such imagination, as that of our gross
bodies being ourselves; which is contrary to experience. Experience
too most clearly shows us the folly of concluding, from the
body and the living agent affecting each other mutually, that the
dissolution of the former is the destruction of the latter. And
there are remarkable instances of their <em>not</em> affecting each other,
which lead us to a contrary conclusion. The supposition, then,
which in all reason we are to go upon, is, that our living nature
will <em>continue</em> after death. And it is infinitely unreasonable to
form an institution of life, or to act, upon any other supposition.</p>

<p>All expectation of immortality, whether more or less certain,
opens an unbounded prospect to our hopes and our fears: since
we see the constitution of nature is such, as to admit of misery,
as well as to be productive of happiness, and experience ourselves
to partake of both in some degree; and since we cannot but know,
what higher degrees of both we are capable of. And there is no
presumption against believing further, that our future interest
depends upon our present behavior: for we see our present interest
doth; and that the happiness and misery, which are naturally
annexed to our actions, very frequently do not follow, till
long after the actions are done, to which they are respectively
annexed. So that were speculation to leave us uncertain, whether
it were likely, that the Author of nature, in giving happiness
and misery to his creatures, hath regard to their actions or not,
yet, since we find by experience that he hath such regard, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
whole sense of things which he has given us, plainly leads us, at
once and without any elaborate inquiries, to think that it may,
indeed must, be to good actions chiefly that he hath annexed
happiness, and to bad actions misery; or that he will, upon the
whole, reward those who do well, and punish those who do evil.</p>

<p>To confirm this from the constitution of the world, it has been
observed, that some sort of moral government is necessarily implied
in that natural government of God, which we experience
ourselves under; that good and bad actions, at present, are naturally
rewarded and punished, not only as beneficial and mischievous
to society, but also as virtuous and vicious: and that there is, in
the very nature of the thing, a tendency to their being rewarded
and punished in a much higher degree than they are at present.
And though this higher degree of distributive justice, which
nature thus points out and leads towards, is prevented for a time
from taking place; it is by obstacles, which the state of this world
unhappily throws in its way, and which therefore are in their
nature temporary. Now, as these things in the natural conduct
of Providence are observable on the side of virtue; so there is
nothing to be set against them on the side of vice. A moral
scheme of government then is visibly established, and, in some
degree, carried into execution: and this, together with the essential
tendencies of virtue and vice duly considered, naturally raise
in us an apprehension, that it will be carried on further towards
perfection in a future state, and that every one shall there receive
according to his deserts.</p>

<p>And if this be so, then our future and general interest, under
the moral government of God, is appointed to depend upon our
behavior; notwithstanding the difficulty, which this may occasion,
of securing it, and the danger of losing it: just in the same manner
as our temporal interest, under his natural government, is
appointed to depend upon our behavior; notwithstanding the
like difficulty and danger. For, from our original constitution,
and that of the world which we inhabit, we are naturally trusted
with ourselves; with our own conduct and our own interest.
And from the same constitution of nature, especially joined with
that course of things which is owing to men, we have temptations
to be unfaithful in this trust; to forfeit this interest, to neglect
it, and run ourselves into misery and ruin. From these temptations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
arise the difficulties of behaving so as to secure our temporal
interest, and the hazard of behaving so as to miscarry in it.
There is therefore nothing incredible in supposing there may be
the like difficulty and hazard with regard to that chief and final
good, which religion lays before us.</p>

<p>The whole account, how it came to pass that we were placed
in such a condition as this, must indeed be beyond our comprehension.
But it is in part accounted for by what religion teaches
us, that the character of virtue and piety must be a necessary
qualification for a future state of security and happiness, under
the moral government of God; in like manner, as some certain
qualifications or other are necessary for every particular condition
of life, under his natural government: and that the present state
was intended to be a school of discipline, for improving in ourselves
that character. Now this intention of nature is rendered
highly credible by observing; that we are plainly made for improvement
of all kinds; that it is a general appointment of Providence,
that we cultivate practical principles, and form within
ourselves habits of action, in order to become fit for what we were
wholly unfit for before; that in particular, childhood and youth
is naturally appointed to be a state of discipline for mature age;
and that the present world is peculiarly fitted for a state of moral
discipline. And, whereas objections are urged against the whole
notion of moral government and a probationary state, from the
opinion of necessity; it has been shown, that God has given us
the evidence, as it were, of experience, that all objections against
religion, on this head, are vain and delusive. He has also, in
his natural government, suggested an answer to all our short-sighted
objections, against the equity and goodness of his moral
government; and in general he has exemplified to us the latter
by the former.</p>

<p>These things, which it is to be remembered, are matters of
fact, ought, in all common sense, to awaken mankind; to induce
them to consider in earnest their condition, and what they have
to do. It is absurd, absurd to the degree of being ridiculous, if
the subject were not of so serious a kind, for men to think themselves
secure in a vicious life; or even in that immoral thoughtlessness,
into which far the greatest part of them are fallen. The
credibility of religion, arising from experience and facts here considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
is fully sufficient, in reason, to engage them to live in
the general practice of all virtue and piety; under the serious
apprehension, though it should be mixed with some doubt,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> of a
righteous administration established in nature, and a future judgment
in consequence of it: especially when we consider, how
very questionable it is, whether any thing at all can be gained by
vice,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> how unquestionably little as well as precarious, the pleasures
and profits of it are at the best, and how soon they must be parted
with at the longest. For, in the deliberations of reason, concerning
what we are to pursue and what to avoid, as temptations to
any thing from mere passion are supposed out of the case, so inducements
to vice, from cool expectations of pleasure and interest
so small and uncertain and short, are really so insignificant, as, in
the view of reason to be almost nothing in <em>themselves</em>; and in
comparison with the importance of religion they quite disappear
and are lost.</p>

<p>Mere passion may indeed be alleged, though not as a reason,
yet as an excuse, for a vicious course of life. And how sorry an
excuse it is, will be manifest by observing, that we are placed in
a condition in which we are unavoidably inured to govern our
passions, by being necessitated to govern them: and to lay ourselves
under the same kind of restraints, and as great ones too,
from temporal regards, as virtue and piety, in the ordinary course
of things, require. The plea of ungovernable passion then, on
the side of vice, is the poorest of all things; for it is no reason,
and a poor excuse. The proper <em>motives</em> to religion are the proper
<em>proofs</em> of it, from our moral nature, from the presages of conscience,
and our natural apprehension of God under the character
of a righteous Governor and Judge: a nature, and conscience,
and apprehension, given us by him; and from the confirmation
of the dictates of reason, by <em>life and immortality brought to light
by the Gospel; and the wrath of God revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men</em>.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE IMPORTANCE OF CHRISTIANITY.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span></h3>

<p>Some persons, upon pretence of the sufficiency of the light
of nature, avowedly reject all revelation, as in its very notion incredible,
and what must be fictitious. And indeed it is certain,
no revelation would have been given, had the light of nature
been sufficient in such a sense, as to render one not wanted and
useless. But no man, in seriousness and simplicity of mind, can
possibly think it so, who considers the state of religion in the
heathen world before revelation, and its present state in those
places which have borrowed no light from it: particularly the
doubtfulness of some of the greatest men, concerning things of
the utmost importance, as well as the natural inattention and
ignorance of mankind in general. It is impossible to say, who
would have been able to have reasoned out that whole system,
which we call Natural Religion, in its genuine simplicity, clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of superstition: but there is certainly no ground to affirm that
the generality could. If they could, there is no sort of probability
that they would. Admitting there were, they would highly
want a standing admonition to remind them of it, and inculcate
it upon them.</p>

<p>And further, were they as much disposed to attend to religion,
as the better sort of men are; yet even upon this supposition,
there would be various occasions for supernatural instruction and
assistance, and the greatest advantages might be afforded by
them.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> So that to say revelation is a thing superfluous, what
there was no need of, and what can be of no service, is, I think, to
talk quite wildly and at random. Nor would it be more extravagant
to affirm, that mankind is so entirely at ease in the present
state, and life so completely happy, that it is a contradiction to
suppose our condition capable of being, in any respect, better.</p>

<p>There are other persons, not to be ranked with these, who
seem to be getting into a way of neglecting, and as it were, overlooking
revelation, as of small importance provided natural religion
be kept to. With little regard either to the evidence of
the former, or to the objections against it, and even upon supposition
of its truth; “the only design of it,” say they, “must
be, to establish a belief of the moral system of nature, and to
enforce the practice of natural piety and virtue. The belief and
practice of these were, perhaps, much promoted by the first publication
of Christianity: but whether they are believed and practised,
upon the evidence and motives of nature or of revelation,
is no great matter,”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This way of considering revelation, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it is not the same with the former, yet borders nearly upon it,
and very much, at length runs up into it: and requires to be
particularly considered, with regard to the persons who seem to
be getting into this way. The consideration of it will likewise
further show the extravagance of the former opinion, and the
truth of the observations in answer to it, just mentioned. And
an inquiry into the importance of Christianity, cannot be an
improper introduction to a treatise concerning the credibility
of it.</p>

<p>Now, if God has given a revelation to mankind, and commanded
those things which are commanded in Christianity; it is
evident, at first sight, that it cannot in any wise be an indifferent
matter, whether we obey or disobey those commands: unless we
are certainly assured, that we know all the reasons for them, and
that all those reasons are now ceased, with regard to mankind in
general, or to ourselves in particular. It is absolutely impossible
we can be assured of this.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> For our ignorance of these reasons
proves nothing in the case: since the whole analogy of nature
shows, what is indeed in itself evident, that there may be infinite
reasons for things, with which we are not acquainted.</p>

<p>But the importance of Christianity will more distinctly appear,
by considering it more distinctly: <i>First</i>, as a republication, and
external institution, of natural or essential religion, adapted to
the present circumstances of mankind, and intended to promote
natural piety and virtue: <i>Secondly</i>, as containing an account of
a dispensation of things, not discoverable by reason, in consequence
of which several distinct precepts are enjoined us. For
though natural religion is the foundation and principal part of
Christianity, it is not in any sense the whole of it.</p>

<p>I. Christianity is a republication of Natural religion. It instructs
mankind in the moral system of the world: that it is the
work of an infinitely perfect Being, and under his government,
that virtue is his law, and that he will finally judge mankind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
righteousness, and render to all according to their works, in a
future state. And, which is very material, it teaches natural
religion in its genuine simplicity; free from those superstitions,
with which it was totally corrupted, and under which it was in a
manner lost.</p>

<p>Revelation is, further, an <em>authoritative</em> publication of natural
religion, and so affords the evidence of testimony for the truth
of it. Indeed the miracles and prophecies recorded in Scripture,
were intended to prove a particular dispensation of Providence,
<i>i.e.</i> the redemption of the world by the Messiah: but this does not
hinder, but that they may also prove God’s general providence
over the world, as our moral governor and judge. And they
evidently do prove it; because this character of the Author of
nature, is necessarily connected with and implied in that particular
revealed dispensation of things: it is likewise continually
taught expressly, and insisted upon, by those persons who
wrought the miracles and delivered the prophecies. So that
indeed natural religion seems as much proved by the Scripture
revelation, as it would have been, had the design of revelation
been nothing else than to prove it.</p>

<p>But it may possibly be disputed, how far miracles can prove
natural religion; and notable objections may be urged against
this proof of it, considered as a matter of speculation: but
considered as a practical thing, there can be none. For
suppose a person to teach natural religion to a nation, who
bid lived in total ignorance or forgetfulness of it; and to
declare that he was commissioned by God so to do; suppose him,
in proof of his commission, to foretell things future, which no
human foresight could have guessed at; to divide the sea with a
word; feed great multitudes with bread from heaven; cure all
manner of diseases; and raise the dead, even himself, to life;
would not this give additional credibility to his teaching, a credibility
beyond what that of a common man would have; and be
an authoritative publication of the law of nature, <i>i.e.</i> a new
proof of it? It would be a practical one, of the strongest kind,
perhaps, which human creatures are capable of having given
them. The Law of Moses then, and the Gospel of Christ, are
authoritative publications of the religion of nature; they afford
a proof of God’s general providence, as moral Governor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
world, as well as of his particular dispensations of providence
towards sinful creatures, revealed in the Law and the Gospel.
As they are the only evidence of the latter, so they are an additional
evidence of the former.</p>

<p>To show this further, let us suppose a man of the greatest and
most improved capacity, who had never heard of revelation, convinced
upon the whole, notwithstanding the disorders of the
world, that it was under the direction and moral government of
an infinitely perfect Being; but ready to question, whether he
were not got beyond the reach of his faculties: suppose him
brought, by this suspicion, into great danger of being carried
away by the universal bad example of almost every one around
him, who appeared to have no sense, no practical sense at least,
of these things: and this, perhaps, would be as advantageous a
situation with regard to religion, as nature alone ever placed any
man in. What a confirmation now must it be to such a person,
all at once, to find, that this moral system of things was revealed
to mankind, in the name of that infinite Being, whom he had
from principles of reason believed in: and that the publishers of
the revelation proved their commission from him, by making it
appear, that he had intrusted them with a power of suspending
and changing the general laws of nature.</p>

<p>Nor must it by any means be omitted, for it is a thing of the
utmost importance, that life and immortality are eminently
brought to light by the Gospel. The great doctrines of a future
state, the danger of a course of wickedness<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and the efficacy of
repentance, are not only confirmed in the Gospel, but are taught,
especially the last is, with a degree of light, to which that of
nature is but darkness.</p>

<p>Further. As Christianity served these ends and purposes,
when it was first published, by the miraculous publication itself,
so it was intended to serve the same purposes in future ages, by
means of the settlement of a visible church:<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> of a society, distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
from common ones, and from the rest of the world, by
peculiar religious institutions; by an instituted method of instruction,
and an instituted form of external religion. Miraculous
powers were given to the first preachers of Christianity, in order
to their introducing it into the world: a visible church was established,
in order to continue it, and carry it on successively
throughout all ages. Had only Moses and the prophets, Christ
and his apostles, taught, and by miracles proved, religion to their
contemporaries; the benefits of their instructions would have
reached but a small part of mankind. Christianity must have
been, in a great degree, sunk and forgot in a very few ages. To
prevent this, appears to have been one reason why a visible
church was instituted; to be like a city upon a hill, a standing
memorial to the world of the duty which we owe our Maker: to
call men continually, both by example and instruction, to attend
to it, and, by the form of religion, ever before their eyes, remind
them of the reality; to be the repository of the oracles of God;
to hold up the light of revelation in aid to that of nature, and to
propagate it, throughout all generations, to the end of the world&mdash;the
light of revelation, considered here in no other view, than as
designed to enforce natural religion. And in proportion as
Christianity is professed and taught in the world, religion, natural
or essential religion, is thus distinctly and advantageously laid
before mankind, and brought again and again to their thoughts,
as a matter of infinite importance.</p>

<p>A visible church has also a further tendency to promote natural
religion, as being an instituted method of education, originally
intended to be of peculiar advantage to those who conform to it.
For one end of the institution was, that, by admonition and reproof,
as well as instruction, by a general regular discipline, and
public exercises of religion, <em>the body of Christ</em>, as the Scripture
speaks, should be <em>edified</em>; <i>i.e.</i> trained up in piety and virtue for
a higher and better state. This settlement, then, appearing thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
beneficial, tending in the nature of the thing to answer, and, in
some degree, actually answering, those ends, it is to be remembered,
that the very notion of it implies positive institutions; for
the visibility of the church consists in them. Take away every
thing of this kind, and you lose the very notion itself. So that
if the things now mentioned are advantages, the reason and importance
of positive institutions in general is most obvious; since
without them these advantages could not be secured to the world.
And it is mere idle wantonness, to insist upon knowing the
reasons, <em>why</em> such particular ones were fixed upon rather than
others.</p>

<p>The benefit arising from this supernatural assistance, which
Christianity affords to natural religion, is what some persons are
very slow in apprehending. And yet it is a thing distinct in
itself, and a very plain obvious one. For will any in good earnest
really say, that the bulk of mankind in the heathen world were
in as advantageous a situation, with regard to natural religion, as
they are now among us: that it was laid before them, and enforced
upon them, in a manner as distinct, and as much tending
to influence their practice?</p>

<p>The objections against all this, from the perversion of Christianity,
and from the supposition of its having had but little good
influence, however innocently they may be proposed, cannot be
insisted upon as conclusive, upon any principles, but such as lead
to downright Atheism; because the manifestation of the law of
nature by reason, which, upon all principles of Theism, must
have been from God, has been perverted and rendered ineffectual
in the same manner. It may indeed, I think, truly be said, that
the good effects of Christianity have not been small; nor its supposed
ill effects, any effects at all of it, properly speaking. Perhaps,
too, the things done have been aggravated; and if not,
Christianity hath been often only a pretence, and the same evils
in the main would have been done upon some other pretence.
However, great and shocking as the corruptions and abuses of it
have really been, they cannot be insisted upon as arguments
against it, upon principles of Theism. For one cannot proceed
one step in reasoning upon natural religion, any more than upon
Christianity, without laying it down as a first principle, that the
dispensations of Providence are not to be judged of by their perversions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
but by their genuine tendencies: not by what they do
actually seem to effect, but by what they would effect if mankind
did their part; that part which is justly put and left upon them.
It is altogether as much the language of one as of the other: <cite>He
that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is holy, let him
be holy still.</cite><a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The light of reason does not, any more than that
of revelation, force men to submit to its authority; both admonish
them of what they ought to do and avoid, together with the consequences
of each; and after this, leave them at full liberty to
act just as they please, till the appointed time of judgment.
Every moment’s experience shows, that this is God’s general rule
of government.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>To return then: Christianity being a promulgation of the law
of nature; being moreover an authoritative promulgation of it;
with new light, and other circumstances of peculiar advantage,
adapted to the wants of mankind; these things fully show its
importance.</p>

<p>It is to be observed further, that as the nature of the case requires,
so all Christians are commanded to contribute, by their
profession of Christianity, to preserve it in the world, and render
it such a promulgation and enforcement of religion. For it is
the very scheme of the Gospel, that each Christian should, in his
degree, contribute towards continuing and carrying it on: all by
uniting in the public profession and external practice of Christianity;
some by instructing, by having the oversight and taking
care of this religious community, the church of God. Now this
further shows the importance of Christianity; and, which is what
I chiefly intend, its importance in a practical sense: or the high
obligations we are under, to take it into our most serious consideration;
and the danger there must necessarily be, not only in treating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it despitefully, which I am not now speaking of, but in disregarding
and neglecting it. For this is neglecting to do what
is expressly enjoined us, for continuing those benefits to the
world, and transmitting them down to future times. And all
this holds, even though the only thing to be considered in Christianity
were its subserviency to natural religion.</p>

<p>II. Christianity is to be considered in a further view; as containing
an account of a dispensation of things, not at all discoverable
by reason, in consequence of which several distinct
precepts are enjoined us. Christianity is not only an external
institution of natural religion, and a new promulgation of God’s
general providence, as righteous governor and judge of the world;
but it contains also a revelation of a particular dispensation of
Providence, carrying on by his Son and Spirit, for the recovery
and salvation of mankind, who are represented in Scripture to
be in a state of ruin. And in consequence of this revelation
being made, we are commanded <em>to be baptized</em>, not only <em>in the
name of the Father</em>, but also, <em>of the Son</em>, <em>and of the Holy
Ghost</em>: and other obligations of duty, unknown before, to the
Son and the Holy Ghost, are revealed. Now the importance of
these duties may be judged of, by observing that they arise, not
from positive command merely, but also from the offices which
appear, from Scripture, to belong to those divine persons in the
Gospel dispensation; or from the relations, which we are there
informed, they stand in to us. By <em>reason</em> is revealed the relation,
which God the Father stands in to us. Hence arises the
obligation of duty which we are under to him. In <em>Scripture</em> are
revealed the relations, which the Son and Holy Spirit stand in
to us. Hence arise the obligations of duty;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> which we are under
to them. The truth of the case, as one may speak, in each of
these three respects being admitted: that God is the governor
of the world, upon the evidence of reason; that Christ is the
mediator between God and man, and the Holy Ghost our guide
and sanctifier, upon the evidence of revelation: the truth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
case, I say, in each of these respects being admitted, it is no
more a question, why it should be commanded, that we be baptized
in the name of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, than that
we be baptized in the name of the Father. This matter seems
to require to be more fully stated.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Let it be remembered then, that religion comes under the
twofold consideration of internal and external: for the latter is
as real a part of religion, of true religion, as the former. Now,
when religion is considered under the first notion, as an inward
principle, to be exerted in such and such inward acts of the mind
and heart, the essence of natural religion may be said to consist
in religious regards to <em>God the Father Almighty</em>: and the essence
of revealed religion, as distinguished from natural, to consist in
religious regards to <em>the Son</em>, and to <em>the Holy Ghost</em>. The obligation
we are under, of paying these religious regards to each of
these divine persons respectively, arises from the respective relations
which they each stand in to us. How these relations are
made known, whether by reason or revelation, makes no alteration
in the case: because the duties arise out of the relations themselves,
not out of the manner in which we are informed of them.
The Son and Spirit have each his proper office in that great dispensation
of Providence, the redemption of the world; the one
our Mediator, the other our Sanctifier. Does not then the duty
of religious regards to both these divine persons, as immediately
arise to the view of reason, out of the very nature of these offices
and relations; as the good-will and kind intention, which we owe
to our fellow-creatures, arise out of the common relations between
us and them? But it will be asked, “What are the inward
religious regards, appearing thus obviously due to the Son
and Holy Spirit; as arising, not merely from command in Scripture,
but from the very nature of the revealed relations, which
they stand in to us?” I answer, the religious regards of reverence,
honor, love, trust, gratitude, fear, hope.</p>

<p>In what external manner this inward worship is to be expressed,
is a matter of pure revealed command, as perhaps the
external manner, in which God the Father is to be worshipped,
may be more so than we are ready to think. But the worship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the internal worship itself, to the Son and Holy Ghost, is no
further matter of pure revealed command, than as the relations
they stand in to us are matter of pure revelation: for the relations
being known, the obligations to such internal worship are
obligations of reason, arising out of those relations themselves.
In short, the history of the gospel as immediately shows us the
reason of these obligations, as it shows us the meaning of the
words, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>If this account of the Christian religion be just, those persons
who can speak lightly of it, as of little consequence, provided
natural religion be kept to, plainly forget, that Christianity, even
what is peculiarly so called, as distinguished from natural religion,
has yet somewhat very important, even of a moral nature.
For the office of our Lord being made known, and the relation
he stands in to us, the obligation of religious regards to him is
plainly moral, as much as charity to mankind is; since this obligation
arises, before external command, immediately out of that
his office and relation itself. Those persons appear to forget,
that revelation is to be considered, as informing us of somewhat
new, in the state of mankind,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and in the government of the
world: as acquainting us with some relations we stand in, which
could not otherwise have been known. These relations being real
(though before revelation we could be under no obligations from
them, yet upon their being revealed), there is no reason to think,
but that neglect of behaving suitably to them will be attended
with the same kind of consequences under God’s government, as
neglecting to behave suitably to any other relations, made known
to us by reason. Ignorance, whether unavoidable or voluntary,
so far as we can possibly see, will just as much, and just as little,
excuse in one case as in the other: the ignorance being supposed
equally unavoidable, or equally voluntary, in both cases.</p>

<p>If therefore Christ be indeed the mediator between God and
man, <i>i.e.</i> if Christianity be true; if he be indeed our Lord, our
Savior, and our God, no one can say, what may follow, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the obstinate, but the careless disregard to him, in those high
relations. Nay, no one can say, what may follow such disregard,
even in the way of natural consequence.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> For, as the natural
consequences of vice in this life are doubtless to be considered as
judicial punishments inflicted by God, so for aught we know, the
judicial punishments of the future life may be, in a like way or
a like sense, the natural consequence of vice:<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> of men’s violating
or disregarding the relations which God has placed them in here,
and made known to them.</p>

<p>If mankind are corrupted and depraved in their moral character,
and so are unfit for that state, which Christ is gone to
prepare for his disciples; and if the assistance of God’s Spirit
be necessary to renew their nature, in the degree requisite to
their being qualified for that state; (all which is implied in the
express, though figurative declaration, <cite>Except a man be born of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>) supposing
this, is it possible any serious person can think it a slight matter,
whether or no he makes use of the means, expressly commanded
by God, for obtaining this divine assistance? Especially since
the whole analogy of nature shows, that we are not to expect
any benefits, without making use of the appointed means for
obtaining or enjoying them. Now reason shows us nothing, of
the particular immediate means of obtaining either temporal or
spiritual benefits. This therefore we must learn, either from
experience or revelation. And experience, the present case does
not admit of.</p>

<p>The conclusion from all this evidently is, that Christianity
being supposed either true or credible, it is unspeakable irreverence,
and really the most presumptuous rashness, to treat it as a
light matter. It can never justly be esteemed of little consequence,
till it be positively supposed false. Nor do I know a
higher and more important obligation which we are under, than
that of examining most seriously into its evidence, supposing
its credibility; and of embracing it, upon supposition of its
truth.</p>

<p>The two following deductions may be proper to be added, in
order to illustrate the foregoing observations, and to prevent their
being mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First</i>, Hence we may clearly see, where lies the distinction
between what is positive and what is moral in religion. Moral
<em>precepts</em>, are precepts the reasons of which we see: positive <em>precepts</em>,
are precepts the reasons of which we do not see.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Moral
<em>duties</em> arise out of the nature of the case itself, prior to external
command. Positive <em>duties</em> do not arise out of the nature of the
case, but from external command; nor would they be duties at
all, were it not for such command, received from Him whose
creatures and subjects we are. But the manner in which the
nature of the case or the fact of the relation, is made known, this
doth not denominate any duty either positive or moral. That we
be baptized in the name of the Father is as much a positive duty,
as that we be baptized in the name of the Son, because both arise
equally from revealed command: though the relation which we
stand in to God the Father is made known to us by reason, and
the relation we stand in to Christ, by revelation only. On the
other hand, the dispensation of the Gospel being admitted, gratitude
as immediately becomes due to Christ, from his being the
voluntary minister of this dispensation, as it is due to God the
Father, from his being the fountain of all good; though the first
is made known to us by revelation only, the second by reason.
Hence also we may see, and, for distinctness’ sake, it may be
worth mentioning, that positive institutions come under a twofold
consideration. They are either institutions founded on natural
religion, as baptism in the name of the Father; (though this has
also a particular reference to the gospel dispensation, for it is in
the name of God, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:) or
they are external institutions founded on revealed religion; as
baptism in the name of the Son; and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, From the distinction between what is moral and
what is positive in religion, appears the ground of that peculiar
preference, which the Scripture teaches us to be due to the
former.</p>

<p>The reason of positive institutions in general, is very obvious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
though we should not see the reason, why particular ones are
pitched upon rather than others. Whoever, therefore, instead
of cavilling at words, will attend to the thing itself, may clearly
see, that positive institutions in general, as distinguished from
this or that particular one, have the nature of moral commands;
since the reasons of them appear. Thus, for instance, the <em>external</em>
worship of God is a moral duty, though no particular mode of it
be so. Care then is to be taken, when a comparison is made between
positive and moral duties, that they be compared no further
than as they are different; no further than as the former are
positive, or arise out of mere external command, the reasons of
which we are not acquainted with; and as the latter are moral,
or arise out of the apparent reason of the case, without such external
command. Unless this caution be observed, we shall run
into endless confusion.</p>

<p>Now this being premised, suppose two standing precepts enjoined
by the same authority; that, in certain conjunctures, it is
impossible to obey both; that the former is moral, <i>i.e.</i> a precept
of which we see the reasons, and that they hold in the particular
case before us; but that the latter is positive, <i>i.e.</i> a precept of
which we do not see the reasons: it is indisputable that our obligations
are to obey the former; because there is an apparent
reason for this preference, and none against it. Further, positive
institutions, all those I suppose which Christianity enjoins, are
means to a moral end: and the end must be acknowledged more
excellent than the means.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Nor is observance of these institutions
any religious obedience at all, or of any value, otherwise than as
it proceeds from a moral principle. This seems to be the strict
logical way of stating and determining this matter; but will, perhaps,
be found less applicable to practice, than may be thought
at first sight.</p>

<p>Therefore, in a more practical, though more lax way of consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and taking the words, <em>moral law</em> and <em>positive institutions</em>,
in the popular sense, I add, that the whole moral law is as
much matter of revealed command, as positive institutions are:
for the Scripture enjoins every moral virtue. In this respect
then they are both upon a level. But the moral law is, moreover,
written upon our hearts; interwoven into our very nature. And
this is a plain intimation of the Author of it, which is to be
preferred, when they interfere.</p>

<p>But there is not altogether so much necessity for the determination
of this question, as some persons seem to think. Nor are
we left to reason alone to determine it. For, <i>First</i>, Though
mankind have, in all ages, been greatly prone to place their religion
in peculiar positive rites, by way of equivalent for obedience
to moral precepts; yet, without making any comparison at all
between them, and consequently without determining which is to
have the preference, the nature of the thing abundantly shows all
notions of that kind to be utterly subversive of true religion, as
they are, moreover, contrary to the whole general tenor of Scripture;
and likewise to the most express particular declarations of
it, that nothing can render us accepted of God, without moral
virtue.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Upon the occasion of mentioning together positive
and moral duties, the Scripture always puts the stress of religion
upon the latter, and never upon the former. This, though no
sort of allowance to neglect the former, when they do not interfere
with the latter, is yet a plain intimation, that when they do, the
latter are to be preferred. And as mankind are for placing the
stress of their religion anywhere, rather than upon virtue; lest
both the reason of the thing, and the general spirit of Christianity,
appearing in the intimation now mentioned, should be ineffectual
against this prevalent folly, our Lord himself, from
whose command alone the obligation of positive institutions arises,
has taken occasion to make the comparison between them and
moral precepts; when the Pharisees censured him, for <em>eating
with publicans and sinners</em>; and also when they censured his
disciples, for <em>plucking the ears of corn on the Sabbath day</em>.
Upon this comparison, he has determined expressly, and in form,
which shall have the preference when they interfere. And by
delivering his authoritative determination in a proverbial manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of expression, he has made it general: <cite>I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The propriety of the word <em>proverbial</em>, is not the
thing insisted upon: though I think the manner of speaking is
to be called so. But that the manner of speaking very remarkably
renders the determination general, is surely indisputable.
For, had it been said only, that God preferred mercy to the rigid
observance of the Sabbath, even then, by parity of reason, most
justly might we have argued, that he preferred mercy likewise,
to the observance of other ritual institutions; and in general,
moral duties, to positive ones. And thus the determination
would have been general; though its being so were inferred and
not expressed. But as the passage really stands in the Gospel,
it is much stronger. For the sense and the very literal words of
our Lord’s answer, are as applicable to any other instance of a
comparison, between positive and moral duties, as to that upon
which they were spoken. And if, in case of competition, mercy
is to be preferred to positive institutions, it will scarce be thought,
that justice is to give place to them. It is remarkable too, that,
as the words are a quotation from the Old Testament, they are
introduced, on both the forementioned occasions, with a declaration,
that the Pharisees did not understand the meaning of them.
This, I say, is very remarkable. For, since it is scarce possible,
for the most ignorant person, not to understand the literal sense
of the passage in the prophet;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and since understanding the
literal sense would not have prevented their <em>condemning the guiltless</em>,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
it can hardly be doubted, that the thing which our Lord
really intended in that declaration was, that the Pharisees had
not learned from it, as they might, wherein the <em>general</em> spirit of
religion consists: that it consists in moral piety and virtue, as
distinguished from ritual observances. However, it is certain we
may learn this from his divine application of the passage, in the
Gospel.</p>

<p>But, as it is one of the peculiar weaknesses of human nature,
when, upon a comparison of two things, one is found to be of
greater importance than the other, to consider this other as of
scarce any importance at all: it is highly necessary that we remind
ourselves, how great presumption it is, to make light of any
institutions of divine appointment; that our obligations to obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
all God’s commands whatever are absolute and indispensable;
and that commands merely positive, admitted to be from him,
lay us under a moral obligation to obey them: an obligation
moral in the strictest and most proper sense.</p>

<p>To these things I cannot forbear adding, that the account now
given of Christianity most strongly shows and enforces upon us
the obligation of searching the Scriptures, in order to see, what
the scheme of revelation really is; instead of determining beforehand,
from reason, what the scheme of it must be.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Indeed if
in revelation there be found any passages, the seeming meaning
of which is contrary to natural religion; we may most certainly
conclude, such seeming meaning not to be the real one.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> But it
is not any degree of a presumption against an interpretation of
Scripture, that such interpretation contains a doctrine, which the
light of nature cannot discover;<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> or a precept, which the law
of nature does not oblige to.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUPPOSED PRESUMPTION AGAINST A REVELATION CONSIDERED
AS MIRACULOUS.</span></h3>

<p>Having shown the importance of the Christian revelation,
and the obligations which we are under seriously to attend to it,
upon supposition of its truth, or its credibility, the next thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
order, is to consider the supposed presumptions against revelation
in general; which shall be the subject of this chapter: and the
objections against the Christian in particular, which shall be the
subject of some following ones.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> For it seems the most natural
method, to remove the prejudices against Christianity, before we
proceed to the consideration of the positive evidence for it, and
the objections against that evidence.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>It is, I think, commonly supposed, that there is some peculiar
presumption, from the analogy of nature, against the Christian
scheme of things, at least against miracles; so as that stronger
evidence is necessary to prove the truth and reality of them, than
would be sufficient to convince us of other events, or matters of
fact. Indeed the consideration of this supposed presumption
cannot but be thought very insignificant, by many persons. Yet,
as it belongs to the subject of this treatise; so it may tend to
open the mind, and remove some prejudices, however needless
the consideration of it be, upon its own account.</p>

<p>I. I find no appearance of a presumption, from the analogy of
nature, against the <em>general scheme</em> of Christianity, that God
created and invisibly governs the world by Jesus Christ; and by
him also will hereafter judge it in righteousness, <i>i.e.</i> render to
every one according to his works; and that good men are under
the secret influence of his Spirit. Whether these things are, or
are not, to be called miraculous, is perhaps only a question about
words; or however, is of no moment in the case. If the analogy
of nature raises any presumption against this general scheme of
Christianity, it must be, either because it is not discoverable by
reason or experience; or else, because it is unlike that course of
nature, which is. But analogy raises no presumption against the
truth of this scheme, upon either of these accounts.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, There is no presumption, from analogy, against the truth
of it, upon account of its not being discoverable by reason or experience.
Suppose one who never heard of revelation, of the most
improved understanding, and acquainted with our whole system of
natural philosophy and natural religion; such a one could not but
be sensible, that it was but a very small part of the natural and
moral system of the universe, which he was acquainted with.
He could not but be sensible, that there must be innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
things, in the dispensations of Providence past, in the invisible
government over the world at present carrying on, and in what
is to come; of which he was wholly ignorant,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and which could
not be discovered without revelation. Whether the scheme of
nature be, in the strictest sense, infinite or not; it is evidently
vast, even beyond all possible imagination. And doubtless that
part of it, which is open to our view, is but as a point in comparison
of the whole plan of Providence, reaching throughout
eternity past and future; in comparison of what is even now
going on, in the remote parts of the boundless universe, nay, in
comparison of the whole scheme of this world. And therefore,
that things lie beyond the natural reach of our faculties, is no
sort of presumption against the truth and reality of them; because
it is certain, there are innumerable things, in the constitution
and government of the universe, which are thus beyond the
natural reach of our faculties.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Analogy raises no presumption against any of the
things contained in this general doctrine of Scripture now mentioned,
upon account of their being unlike the known course of
nature. For there is no presumption at all from analogy, that
the <em>whole</em> course of things, or divine government naturally unknown
to us, and <em>every thing</em> in it, is like to any thing in that
which is known; and therefore no peculiar presumption against
any thing in the former, upon account of its being unlike to any
thing in the latter. And in the constitution and natural government
of the world, as well as in the moral government of it, we
see things, in a great degree, unlike one another: and therefore
ought not to wonder at such unlikeness between things visible
and invisible. However, the scheme of Christianity is by no
means entirely unlike the scheme of nature; as will appear in
the following part of this treatise.</p>

<p>The notion of a miracle, considered as a proof of a divine
mission, has been stated with great exactness by divines; and is,
I think, sufficiently understood by every one. There are also
invisible miracles,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the Incarnation of Christ, for instance, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
being secret, cannot be alleged as a proof of such a mission; but
require themselves to be proved by visible miracles. Revelation
itself too is miraculous; and miracles are the proof of it; and
the supposed presumption against these shall presently be considered.
All which I have been observing here is, that, whether
we choose to call every thing in the dispensations of Providence,
not discoverable without revelation, nor like the known course of
things, miraculous; and whether the general Christian dispensation
now mentioned is to be called so, or not; the foregoing
observations seem certainly to show, that there is no presumption
against it from the analogy of nature.</p>

<p>II. There is no presumption, from analogy, against some operations,
which we should now call miraculous; particularly none
against a revelation at the beginning of the world: nothing of
such presumption against it, as is supposed to be implied or expressed
in the word, <em>miraculous</em>.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> A miracle, in its very notion,
is relative to a course of nature; and implies something different
from it, considered as being so. Now, either there was no
course of nature at the time which we are speaking of; or if
there were, we are not acquainted what the course of nature is,
upon the first peopling of worlds. Therefore the question,
whether mankind had a revelation made to them at <em>that</em> time, is
to be considered, not as a question concerning a miracle, but as a
common question of fact. And we have the like reason, be it
more or less, to admit the report of tradition, concerning this
question, and concerning common matters of fact of the same
antiquity; for instance, what part of the earth was first peopled.</p>

<p>Or thus: When mankind was first placed in this state, there
was a power exerted, totally different from the present course of
nature. Now, whether this power, thus wholly different from the
present course of nature, (for we cannot properly apply to it the
word <em>miraculous</em>;) whether this power <em>stopped</em> immediately after
it had made man, or went on, and exerted itself further in giving
him a revelation, is a question of the same kind, as whether an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
ordinary power exerted itself in such a particular <em>degree</em> and
manner, or not.</p>

<p>Or suppose the power exerted in the formation of the world be
considered as miraculous, or rather, be called by that name; the
case will not be different: since it must be acknowledged, that
such a power was exerted. For supposing it acknowledged, that
our Savior spent some years in a course of working miracles:<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
there is no more presumption, worth mentioning, against his
having exerted this miraculous power, in a certain degree greater,
than in a certain degree less; in one or two more instances, than
in one or two fewer; in this, than in another manner.</p>

<p>It is evident then, that there can be no peculiar presumption,
from the analogy of nature, against supposing a revelation, when
man was first placed upon earth.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Add, that there does not appear the least intimation in history
or tradition, that religion was first reasoned out: but the whole
of history and tradition makes for the other side, that it came
into the world by revelation. Indeed the state of religion, in the
first ages of which we have any account, seems to suppose and
imply, that this was the original of it among mankind.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> And
these reflections together, without taking in the peculiar authority
of Scripture, amount to real and a very material degree of evidence,
that there was a revelation at the beginning of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Now this, as it is a confirmation of natural religion, and therefore
mentioned in the former part of this treatise;<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> so likewise it
has a tendency to remove any prejudices against a subsequent
revelation.</p>

<p>III. But still it may be objected, that there is some peculiar
presumption, from analogy, against miracles; particularly against
revelation, after the settlement and during the continuance of a
course of nature.</p>

<p>Now with regard to this supposed presumption, it is to be observed
in general, that before we can have ground for raising
what can, with any propriety, be called an <em>argument</em> from analogy,
for or against revelation considered as something miraculous, we
must be acquainted with a similar or parallel case. But the history
of some other world, seemingly in like circumstances with
our own, is no more than a parallel case: and therefore nothing
short of this can be so. Yet, could we come at a presumptive
proof, for or against a revelation, from being informed, whether
such world had one, or not; such a proof, being drawn from
one single instance only, must be infinitely precarious. More
particularly:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, There is a very strong presumption against common
speculative truths, and against the most ordinary facts, before the
proof<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> of them; which yet is overcome by almost any proof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
There is a presumption of millions to one, against the story of
Cæsar, or of any other man. For suppose a number of common
facts so and so circumstanced, of which we had no kind of proof,
should happen to come into one’s thoughts; every one would,
without any possible doubt, conclude them to be false. And the
like may be said of a single common fact. Hence it appears,
that the question of importance, as to the matter before us, is,
concerning the <em>degree</em> of the peculiar presumption supposed
against miracles; not whether there be any peculiar presumption
at all against them. For, if there be the presumption of millions
to one, against the most common facts; what can a small presumption,
additional to this, amount to, though it be peculiar?
It cannot be estimated, and is as nothing. The only material
question is, whether there be any such presumptions against
miracles, as to render them in any sort incredible.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, If we leave out the consideration of religion, we are
in such total darkness, upon what causes, occasions, reasons, or
circumstances, the present course of nature depends; that there
does not appear any improbability for or against supposing, that
five or six thousand years may have given scope<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> for causes,
occasions, reasons, or circumstances, from whence miraculous
interpositions may have arisen. And from this, joined with the
foregoing observation, it will follow, that there must be a presumption,
beyond all comparison greater, against the <em>particular</em>
common facts just now instanced in, than against miracles <em>in
general</em>; before any evidence of either.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Take in the consideration of religion, or the moral
system of the world, and then we see distinct particular reasons
for miracles: to afford mankind instruction additional to that of
nature, and to attest the truth of it. This gives a real credibility
to the supposition, that it might be part of the original plan of
things, that there should be miraculous interpositions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, Miracles must not be compared to common natural
events, or to events which, though uncommon, are similar to
what we daily experience: but to the extraordinary phenomena
of nature. And then the comparison will be between the presumption
against miracles, and the presumption against such
uncommon appearances, suppose, as comets, and against there
being any such powers in nature as magnetism and electricity, so
contrary to the properties of other bodies not endued with these
powers. And before any one can determine, whether there be
any peculiar presumption against miracles, more than against
other extraordinary things; he must consider, what, upon first
hearing, would be the presumption against the last mentioned
appearances and powers, to a person acquainted only with the
daily, monthly, and annual course of nature respecting this earth,
and with those common powers of matter which we every day see.</p>

<p>Upon all this I conclude; that there certainly is no such presumption
against miracles, as to render them in any wise incredible:
that, on the contrary, our being able to discern reasons
for them, gives a positive credibility to the history of them, in
cases where those reasons hold: and that it is by no means certain,
that there is any <em>peculiar</em> presumption at all, from analogy,
even in the lowest degree, against miracles, as distinguished from
other extraordinary phenomena: though it is not worth while to
perplex the reader with inquiries into the abstract nature of evidence,
in order to determine a question, which, without such inquiries,
we see<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is of no importance.</p>

<span class="smaller">OUR INCAPACITY OF JUDGING, WHAT WERE TO BE EXPECTED
IN A REVELATION; AND THE CREDIBILITY, FROM ANALOGY,
THAT IT MUST CONTAIN THINGS LIABLE TO OBJECTIONS.</span></h3>

<p>Besides the objections against the <em>evidence</em> for Christianity,
many are alleged against the <em>scheme</em> of it; against the whole
manner in which it is put and left with the world; as well as
against several particular relations in Scripture: objections drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
from the deficiencies of revelation: from things in it appearing
to men <em>foolishness</em>;<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> from its containing matters of offence,
which have led, and it must have been foreseen would lead, into
strange enthusiasm and superstition, and be made to serve the
purposes of tyranny and wickedness; from its not being universal;
and, which is a thing of the same kind, from its evidence not
being so convincing and satisfactory as it might have been: for
this last is sometimes turned into a positive argument against its
truth.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>It would be tedious, indeed impossible, to enumerate the
several particulars comprehended under the objections here referred
to; they being so various, according to the different
fancies of men. There are persons who think it a strong objection
against the authority of Scripture, that it is not composed by
rules of art, agreed upon by critics, for polite and correct writing.
And the scorn is inexpressible, with which some of the prophetic
parts of Scripture are treated: partly through the rashness of
interpreters; but very much also, on account of the hieroglyphical
and figurative language, in which they are left us.</p>

<p>Some of the principal things of this sort shall be particularly
considered in the following chapters. But my design at present
is to observe in general, with respect to this whole way of arguing,
that, upon supposition of a revelation, it is highly credible beforehand,
that we should be incompetent judges of it to a great degree:
and that it would contain many things appearing to us
liable to great objections; in case we judge of it otherwise, than
by the analogy of nature. Therefore, though objections against
the <em>evidence</em> of Christianity are most seriously to be considered,
yet objections against Christianity itself are, in a great measure,
frivolous: almost all objections against it, excepting those which
are alleged against the particular proofs of its coming from God.
I express myself with caution, lest I should be mistaken to vilify
reason; which is indeed the only faculty we have wherewith to
judge concerning any thing, even revelation itself: or be misunderstood
to assert, that a supposed revelation cannot be proved
false, from internal characters. For, it may contain clear immoralities
or contradictions; and either of these would prove it false.
Nor will I take upon me to affirm, that nothing else can possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
render any supposed revelation incredible. Yet still the observation
above, is, I think, true beyond doubt; that objections against
Christianity, as distinguished from objections against its evidence,
are frivolous. To make out this, is the general design of the
present chapter.</p>

<p>With regard to the whole of it, I cannot but particularly wish,
that the <em>proofs</em> might be attended to; rather than the assertions
cavilled at, upon account of any unacceptable <em>consequences</em>, real
or supposed, which may be drawn from them. For, after all,
that which is true, must be admitted, though it should show us
the shortness of our faculties: and that we are in no wise judges
of many things, of which we are apt to think ourselves very
competent ones. Nor will this be any objection with reasonable
men; at least upon second thought it will not be any objection
with such, against the justness of the following observations.</p>

<p>As God governs the world and instructs his creatures, according
to certain laws or rules, in the known course of nature;
known by reason together with experience: so the Scripture
informs us of a scheme of divine Providence, additional to this.
It relates, that God has, by revelation, instructed men in things
concerning his government, which they could not otherwise have
known; and reminded them of things, which they might otherwise
know; and attested the truth of the whole by miracles.
Now if the natural and the revealed dispensation of things are
both from God, if they coincide with each other, and together
make up one scheme of Providence; our being incompetent
judges of one, must render it credible, that we may be incompetent
judges also of the other. Upon experience, the acknowledged
constitution and course of nature is found to be greatly
different from what, before experience, would have been expected;
and such as, men fancy, there lie great objections
against. This renders it beforehand highly credible, that they
may find the revealed dispensation likewise, if they judge of it as
they do of the constitution of nature, very different from expectations
formed beforehand; and liable, in appearance, to great
objections: objections against the scheme itself, and against the
degrees and manners of the miraculous interpositions by which
it was attested and carried on. Thus, suppose a prince to govern
his dominions in the wisest manner possible, by common known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
laws; and that upon some exigencies he should suspend these
laws; and govern, in several instances, in a different manner.
If one of his subjects were not a competent judge beforehand, by
what common rules the government should or would be carried
on; it could not be expected, that the same person would be a
competent judge, in what exigencies, or in what manner, or to
what degree, those laws commonly observed would be suspended
or deviated from. If he were not a judge of the wisdom of the
ordinary administration, there is no reason to think he would be
a judge of the wisdom of the extraordinary. If he thought he
had objections against the former; doubtless, it is highly supposable,
he might think also, that he had objections against the
latter. And thus, as we fall into infinite follies and mistakes,
whenever we pretend, otherwise than from experience and analogy,
to judge of the constitution and course of nature; it is evidently
supposable beforehand, that we should fall into as great,
in pretending to judge in like manner concerning revelation.
Nor is there any more ground to expect that this latter should
appear to us clear of objections, than that the former should.</p>

<p>These observations, relating to the whole of Christianity, are
applicable to inspiration in particular. As we are in no sort
judges beforehand, by what laws or rules, in what degree, or by
what means, it were to have been expected, that God would naturally
instruct us; so upon supposition of his affording us light and
instruction by revelation, additional to what he has afforded us
by reason and experience, we are in no sort judges, by what
methods, and in what proportion, it were to be expected that this
supernatural light and instruction would be afforded us. We
know not beforehand, what degree or kind of natural information
it were to be expected God would afford men, each by his own
reason and experience: nor how far he would enable and effectually
dispose them to communicate it, whatever it should be, to
each other; nor whether the evidence of it would be certain,
highly probable, or doubtful; nor whether it would be given with
equal clearness and conviction to all. Nor could we guess, upon
any good ground I mean, whether natural knowledge, or even the
faculty itself, by which we are capable of attaining it, reason,
would be given us at once, or gradually.</p>

<p>In like manner, we are wholly ignorant, what degree of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
knowledge, it were to be expected, God would give mankind by
revelation, upon supposition of his affording one: or how far, or
in what way, he would interpose miraculously, to qualify them, to
whom he should originally make the revelation, for communicating
the knowledge given by it; and to secure their doing it to
the age in which they should live; and to secure its being transmitted
to posterity. We are equally ignorant, whether the evidence
of it would be certain or highly probable, or doubtful:<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> or
whether all who should have any degree of instruction from it,
and any degree of evidence of its truth, would have the same:
or whether the scheme would be revealed at once, or unfolded
gradually.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Nay we are not in any sort able to judge, whether
it were to have been expected, that the revelation should have
been committed to writing; or left to be handed down, and
consequently corrupted, by verbal tradition, and at length sunk
under it, if mankind so pleased, and during such time as
they are permitted, in the degree they evidently are, to act as
they will.</p>

<p>But it may be said, “that a revelation in some of the above-mentioned
circumstances, one, for instance, which was not committed
to writing, and thus secured against danger of corruption,
would not have answered its purpose.” I ask, what purpose? It
would not have answered all the purposes, which it has now
answered, and in the same degree: but it would have answered
others, or the same in different degrees. And which of these
were the purposes of God, and best fell in with his general
government, we could not at all have determined beforehand.</p>

<p>Now since we have no principles of reason, upon which to judge
beforehand, how it were to be expected that revelation should
have been left, or what was most suitable to the divine plan of
government, in any of the forementioned respects; it must be
quite frivolous to object afterwards as to any of them, against its
being left in one way, rather than another: for this would be to
object against things, upon account of their being different from
expectations, which has been shown to be without reason.</p>

<p>Thus we see, that the only question concerning the truth of
Christianity is, whether it be a real revelation; not whether it
be attended with every circumstance which we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
looked for: and concerning the authority of Scripture, whether
it be what it claims to be; not whether it be a book of such sort,
and so promulged, as weak men are apt to fancy a book containing
a divine revelation should be. Therefore, neither obscurity,
nor seeming inaccuracy of style, nor various readings, nor early
disputes about the authors of particular parts, nor any other
things of the like kind, though they had been much more considerable
in degree than they are, could overthrow the authority
of the Scripture: unless the prophets, apostles, or our Lord,
had promised, that the book containing the divine revelation
should be exempt from those things. Nor indeed can any objections
overthrow such a kind of revelation as the Christian claims
to be, (since there are no objections against the morality of it,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>)
but such as can show, that there is no proof of miracles wrought
originally in attestation of it; no appearance of any thing miraculous
in its obtaining in the world; nor any of prophecy, that
is, of events foretold, which human sagacity could not foresee.
If it can be shown, that the proof alleged for all these is absolutely
none at all, then is revelation overturned. But were it
allowed, that the proof of any one or all of them is lower than
is allowed; yet, whilst <em>any</em> proof of them remains, revelation
will stand upon much the same foot it does at present, as to all the
purposes of life and practice, and ought to have the like influence
upon our behavior.</p>

<p>From the foregoing observations too, it will follow, and those
who will thoroughly examine into revelation will find it worth
remarking, that there are several ways of arguing, which though
just with regard to other writings, are not applicable to Scripture:
at least not to its prophetic parts. We cannot argue, for instance,
that such and such cannot be the sense or intent of a passage
of Scripture, for, if it had, it would have been expressed more
plainly, or represented under a more apt figure or hieroglyphic.
Yet we may justly argue thus, with respect to common books.
And the reason of this difference is very evident. In Scripture
we are not competent judges, as we are in common books, how
plainly it were to have been expected, that the sense should
have been expressed, or under how apt an image figured. The
only question is, what appearance there is, that this <em>is</em> the sense;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and scarce at all, how much more determinately or accurately it
might have been expressed or figured.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>“But is it not self-evident, that internal improbabilities of all
kinds weaken external probable proof?” Doubtless. But to
what practical purpose can this be alleged here, when it has been
proved before,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> that real internal improbabilities, which rise even
to moral certainty, are overcome by the most ordinary testimony;
and when it now has been made to appear, that we scarce know
what are improbabilities, as to the matter we are here considering:
as it will further appear from what follows.</p>

<p>From the observations made above it is manifest, that we are
not in any sort competent judges, what supernatural instruction
were to have been expected; and it is self-evident, that the
objections of an incompetent judgment must be frivolous. Yet
it may be proper to go one step further, and observe, that if men
will be regardless of these things, and pretend to judge of the
Scripture by preconceived expectations; the analogy of nature
shows beforehand, not only that it is highly credible they may,
but also probable that they will, imagine they have strong objections
against it, however really unexceptionable. For so, prior to
experience, they would think they had, against the circumstances,
and degrees, and the whole manner of that instruction, which is
afforded by the ordinary course of nature. Were the instruction
which God affords to brute creatures by instincts and mere propensions,
and to mankind by these together with reason, matter
of probable proof, and not of certain observation: it would be
rejected as incredible, in many instances of it, only upon account
of the means by which this instruction is given, the seeming disproportions,
the limitations, necessary conditions, and circumstances
of it. For instance: would it not have been thought
highly improbable, that men should have been so much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
capable of discovering, even to certainty, the general laws of
matter, and the magnitudes, paths, and revolutions, of heavenly
bodies; than the occasions and cures of distempers, and many
other things in which human life seems so much more nearly concerned,
than in astronomy? How capricious and irregular a way
of information would it be said; is that of <em>invention</em>, by means
of which nature instructs us in matters of science, and in many
things, upon which the affairs of the world greatly depend: that
a man should, by this faculty, be made acquainted with a thing
in an instant, (when perhaps he is thinking of something else,)
which he has in vain been searching after, it may be, for years.</p>

<p>So likewise the imperfections attending the only method, by
which nature enables and directs us to communicate our thoughts
to each other, are innumerable. Language is, in its very nature,
inadequate, ambiguous, liable to infinite abuse, even from negligence;
and so liable to it from design, that every man can deceive
and betray by it. And, to mention but one instance more; that
brutes, without reason, should act, in many respects, with a
sagacity and foresight vastly greater than what men have in those
respects, would be thought impossible. Yet it is certain they do
act with such superior foresight: whether it be their own, indeed,
is another question. From these things, it is highly credible
beforehand, that upon supposition that God should afford men
some additional instruction by revelation, it would be with circumstances,
in manners, degrees, and respects, against the credibility
of which we should be apt to fancy we had great objections.
Nor are the objections against the Scripture, nor against Christianity
in general, at all more or greater, than the analogy of
nature would beforehand&mdash;not perhaps give ground to <em>expect</em>;
(for the analogy may not be sufficient, in some cases, to ground
an expectation upon;) but no more nor greater, than analogy
would show it, beforehand, to be supposable and <em>credible</em>, that
there might seem to lie against revelation.</p>

<p>By applying these general observations to a particular objection,
it will be more distinctly seen, how they are applicable to
others of the like kind; and indeed to almost all objections
against Christianity, as distinguished from objections against its
evidence. It appears from Scripture, that, as it was not unusual
in the apostolic age, for persons, upon their conversion to Christianity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to be endued with miraculous gifts; so, some of those
persons exercised these gifts in a strangely irregular and disorderly
manner;<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and this is made an objection against their
being really miraculous. Now the foregoing observations quite
remove this objection, how considerable soever it may appear at
first sight. For, consider a person endued with any of these
gifts, for instance that of tongues: it is to be supposed, that he
had the same power over this miraculous gift, as he would have
had over it, had it been the effect of habit, of study and use, as it
ordinarily is; or the same power over it, as he had over any other
natural endowment. Consequently, he would use it in the same
manner as he did any other; either regularly, and upon proper
occasions only, or irregularly, and upon improper ones: according
to his sense of decency, and his character of prudence.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
Where then is the objection? Why, if this miraculous power
was indeed given to the world to propagate Christianity, and
attest the truth of it, we might, it seems, have expected, that
other sort of persons should have been chosen to be invested
with it; or that these should, at the same time, have been
endued with prudence; or that they should have been continually
restrained and directed in the exercise of it: <i>i.e.</i> that
God should have miraculously interposed, if at all, in a different
manner, or higher degree. But, from the observations made
above, it is undeniably evident, that we are not judges in what
degrees and manners it were to have been expected he should
miraculously interpose; upon supposition of his doing it in some
degree and manner. Nor, in the natural course of Providence,
are superior gifts of memory, eloquence, knowledge, and other
talents of great influence, conferred only on persons of prudence
and decency, or such as are disposed to make the properest use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of them. Nor is the instruction and admonition naturally
afforded us for the conduct of life, particularly in our education,
commonly given in a manner the most suited to recommend it;
but often with circumstances apt to prejudice us against such
instruction.</p>

<p>One might go on to add, there is a great resemblance between
the light of nature and of revelation, in several other respects.
Practical Christianity, or that faith and behavior which renders
a man a Christian, is a plain and obvious thing: like the common
rules of conduct, with respect to ordinary temporal affairs. The
more distinct and particular knowledge of those things, the study
of which the apostle calls <em>going on unto perfection</em>,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and of the
prophetic parts of revelation, like many parts of natural and even
civil knowledge, may require very exact thought, and careful
consideration. The hinderances too, of natural, and of supernatural
light and knowledge, have been of the same kind. And
as it is owned the whole scheme of Scripture is not yet understood;
so, if it ever comes to be understood, before the <em>restitution
of all things</em>,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and without miraculous interpositions, it must be
in the same way as natural knowledge is come at: by the continuance
and progress of learning and of liberty;<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and by particular
persons attending to, comparing, and pursuing, intimations
scattered up and down it, which are overlooked and disregarded
by the generality of the world. For this is the way in which all
improvements are made; by thoughtful men’s tracing on obscure
hints, dropped us by nature as it were, accidentally, or which
seem to come into our minds by chance. Nor is it at all incredible,
that a book which has been so long in the possession of mankind,
should contain many truths as yet undiscovered. For, all
the same phenomena, and the same faculties of investigation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
from which such great discoveries in natural knowledge have
been made in the present and last age, were equally in the possession
of mankind, several thousand years before. And possibly
it might be intended, that events, as they come to pass, should
open and ascertain the meaning of several parts of Scripture.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that this analogy fails in a material respect:
for that natural knowledge is of little or no consequence.
But I have been speaking of the general instruction which nature
does or does not afford us. And besides, some parts of natural
knowledge, in the more common restrained sense of the words,
are of the greatest consequence to the ease and convenience of
life. But suppose the analogy did, as it does not, fail in this
respect; yet it might be abundantly supplied, from the whole
constitution and course of nature: which shows, that God does
not dispense his gifts according to <em>our</em> notions of the advantage
and consequence they would be of to us. And this in general,
with his method of dispensing knowledge in particular, would
together make out an analogy full to the point before us.</p>

<p>But it may be objected still further and more generally; “The
Scripture represents the world as in a state of ruin, and Christianity
as an expedient to recover it, to help in these respects
where nature fails: in particular, to supply the deficiencies of
natural light. Is it credible then, that so many ages should have
been let pass, before a matter of such a sort, of so great and so
general importance, was made known to mankind; and then that
it should be made known to so small a part of them? Is it conceivable,
that this supply should be so very deficient, should have
the like obscurity and doubtfulness, be liable to the like perversions,
in short, lie open to all the like objections, as the light of
nature itself?”<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Without determining how far this, in fact, is so, I answer; it
is by no means incredible, that it might be so, if the light of
nature and of revelation be from the same hand. Men are
naturally liable to diseases: for which God, in his good providence,
has provided natural remedies.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But remedies existing
in nature have been unknown to mankind for many ages; are
known but to few now; probably many valuable ones are not
known yet. Great has been and is the obscurity and difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in the nature and application of them. Circumstances <em>seem</em>
often to make them very improper, where they are absolutely
necessary. It is after long labor and study, and many unsuccessful
endeavors, that they are brought to be as useful as they are;
after high contempt and absolute rejection of the most useful we
have; and after disputes and doubts, which have seemed to be
endless. The best remedies too, when unskilfully, much more
when dishonestly applied, may produce new diseases; and with
the rightest application the success of them is often doubtful.
In many cases they are not effectual: where they are, it is often
very slowly: and the application of them, and the necessary
regimen accompanying it, is not uncommonly so disagreeable,
that some will not submit to them; and satisfy themselves with
the excuse, that if they would, it is not certain whether it would
be successful. And many persons, who labor under diseases, for
which there are known natural remedies, are not so happy as to
be always, if ever, in the way of them. In a word, the remedies
which nature has provided for diseases are neither certain, perfect,
nor universal. And indeed the same principles of arguing,
which would lead us to conclude, that they must be so, would
lead us likewise to conclude, that there could be no occasion for
them; <i>i.e.</i> that there could be no diseases at all. And therefore
our experience that there are diseases, shows that it is credible
beforehand, upon supposition nature has provided remedies for
them, that these remedies may be, as by experience we find they
are, neither certain, nor perfect, nor universal; because it shows,
that the principles upon which we should expect the contrary are
fallacious.</p>

<p>And now, what is the just consequence from all these things?
Not that reason is no judge of what is offered to us as being of
divine revelation. For this would be to infer that we are unable
to judge of any thing, because we are unable to judge of all
things. Reason can, and it ought to judge, not only of the
meaning, but also of the morality and the evidence of revelation.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, It is the province of reason to judge of the morality of
the Scripture; <i>i.e.</i> not whether it contains things different from
what we should have expected from a wise, just, and good Being;
(for objections from hence have been now obviated:) but whether
it contains things plainly contradictory to wisdom, justice, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
goodness; to what the light of nature teaches us of God. And
I know nothing of this sort objected against Scripture, excepting
such objections as are formed upon suppositions, which would
equally conclude, that the constitution of nature is contradictory
to wisdom, justice, or goodness; which most certainly it is not.
There are, indeed, some particular precepts in Scripture, given
to particular persons, requiring actions, which would be immoral
and vicious, were it not for such precepts. But it is easy to see,
that all these are of such a kind, as that the precept changes the
whole nature of the case and of the action; and both constitutes
and shows that not to be unjust or immoral, which, prior to the
precept, must have appeared and really been so: which may well
be, since none of these precepts are contrary to immutable
morality. If it were commanded, to cultivate the <em>principles</em>,
and act from the spirit of treachery, ingratitude, cruelty; the
command would not alter the nature of the case or of the action,
in any of these instances. But it is quite otherwise in precepts,
which require only the doing an <em>external action</em>: for instance,
taking away the property, or life of any. For men have no
right, either to life or property, but what arises solely from the
grant of God. When this grant is revoked, they cease to have
any right at all in either: and when this revocation is made
known, as surely it is possible it may be, it must cease to be unjust
to deprive them of either. And though a course of external
acts, which without command would be immoral, must
make an immoral habit; yet a few detached commands have no
such natural tendency. I thought proper to say thus much of
the few Scripture precepts, which require, not vicious actions,
but actions which would have been vicious, but for such precepts;
because they are sometimes weakly urged as immoral, and
great weight is laid upon objections drawn from them.</p>

<p>To me there seems no difficulty at all in these precepts, but
what arises from their being offences: <i>i.e.</i> from their being liable
to be perverted, as indeed they are, by wicked designing men,
to serve the most horrid purposes; and perhaps to mislead the
weak and enthusiastic. And objections from this head are not
objections against revelation; but against the whole notion of religion,
as a trial: and against the general constitution of nature.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Reason is able to judge, and must, of the evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of revelation, and of the objections urged against that evidence:
which shall be the subject of a following chapter.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>The consequence of the foregoing observations is, that the
question upon which the truth of Christianity depends, is scarcely
at all what objections there are against its scheme, since there
are none against the morality of it, but <em>what objections there are
against its evidence</em>; or, <em>what proof there remains of it, after
due allowances are made for the objections against that proof</em>:
because it has been shown, that the <em>objections against Christianity,
as distinguished from objections against its evidence, are
frivolous</em>. For surely very little weight, if any at all, is to be
laid upon a way of arguing and objecting, which, when applied
to the general constitution of nature, experience shows not to be
conclusive: and such, I think, is the whole way of objecting
treated of throughout this chapter. It is resolvable into principles,
and goes upon suppositions, which mislead us to think, that
the Author of nature would not act, as we experience he does;
or would act, in such and such cases, as we experience he does
not in like cases. But the unreasonableness of this way of objecting
will appear yet more evidently from hence, that the chief
things thus objected against are justified, as shall be further
shown,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> by distinct, particular, and full analogies, in the constitution
and course of nature.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, that, as frivolous as objections of the
foregoing sort against revelation are, yet, when a supposed revelation
is more consistent with itself, and has a more general and
uniform tendency to promote virtue, than, all circumstances considered,
could have been expected from enthusiasm and political
views, this is a presumptive proof of its not proceeding from
them, and so of its truth: because we are competent judges, what
might have been expected from enthusiasm and political views.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">CHRISTIANITY, CONSIDERED AS A SCHEME OR CONSTITUTION,
IMPERFECTLY COMPREHENDED.</span></h3>

<p>As hath been now shown,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> the analogy of nature renders it
highly credible beforehand, that, supposing a revelation to be
made, it must contain many things very different from what we
should have expected, and such as appear open to great objections:
and that this observation, in good measure, takes off the force of
those objections, or rather precludes them. It may be alleged,
that this is a very partial answer to such objections, or a very
unsatisfactory way of obviating them: because it does not show
at all, that the things objected against can be wise, just, and
good; much less, that it is credible they are so. It will therefore
be proper to show this distinctly; by applying to these
objections against the wisdom, justice, and goodness of Christianity,
the answer above<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> given to the like objections against
the constitution of nature: before we consider the particular
analogies in the latter, to the particular things objected against
in the former. Now that which affords a sufficient answer to
objections against the wisdom, justice, and goodness of the constitution
of nature, is its being a constitution, a system, or
scheme, imperfectly comprehended;<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> a scheme in which means
are made use of to accomplish ends; and which is carried on by
general laws. For from these things it has been proved, not
only to be possible, but also to be credible, that those things
which are objected against may be consistent with wisdom,
justice, and goodness; nay, may be instances of them: and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that the constitution and government of nature may be perfect
in the highest possible degree. If Christianity then be a scheme,
and of the like kind; it is evident, the like objections against it
must admit of the like answer. And,</p>

<p>I. Christianity is a scheme, quite beyond our comprehension.</p>

<p>The moral government of God is exercised, by gradually conducting
things so in the course of his providence, that every one,
at length and upon the whole, shall receive according to his
deserts; and neither fraud nor violence, but truth and right,
shall finally prevail. Christianity is a particular scheme under
this general plan of Providence, and a part of it, conducive to
its completion, with regard to mankind: consisting itself also of
various parts, and a mysterious economy, which has been carrying
on from the time the world came into its present wretched
state, and is still carrying on, for its recovery, by a divine person,
the Messiah; who is to <cite>gather together in one the children
of God, that are scattered abroad</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and establish <cite>an everlasting
kingdom, wherein dwelleth righteousness</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In order to it; after
various manifestations of things, relating to this great and general
scheme of Providence, through a succession of many ages:
(For <cite>the Spirit of Christ which was in the prophets, testified beforehand
his sufferings, and the glory that should follow: unto
whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they
did minister the things which are now reported unto us by them
that have preached the Gospel; which things the angels desire to
look into</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>)&mdash;after various dispensations looking forward and preparatory
to, this final salvation: <cite>in the fulness of time</cite>, when infinite
wisdom thought fit; He, <cite>being in the form of God,&mdash;made
himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found
in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient
to death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath
highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every
name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven, and things in the earth, and things under the
earth: and that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</cite><a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Parts likewise of this
economy are the miraculous mission of the Holy Ghost, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
ordinary assistances given to good men:<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> the invisible government,
which Christ at present exercises over his church: that
which he himself refers to in these words: <cite>In my Father’s house
are many mansions&mdash;I go to prepare a place for you</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and his
future return to <cite>judge the world in righteousness</cite>, and completely
re-establish the kingdom of God. <cite>For the Father judgeth no
man; but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all
men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.</cite><a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> <cite>All
power is given unto him in heaven and in earth.</cite><a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> <cite>And he must
reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. Then cometh
the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,
even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all
authority and power. And when all things shall be subdued
unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that
put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</cite><a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Surely
little need be said to show, that this system, or scheme of things,
is but imperfectly comprehended by us. The Scripture expressly
asserts it to be so. And indeed one cannot read a passage relating
to this <em>great mystery of godliness</em>,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> but what immediately
runs up into something which shows us our ignorance in it; as
every thing in nature shows us our ignorance in the constitution
of nature. And whoever will seriously consider that part
of the Christian scheme, which is revealed in Scripture, will find
so much more unrevealed, as will convince him, that, to all the
purposes of judging and objecting, we know as little of it, as of
the constitution of nature. Our ignorance, therefore, is as much
an answer to our objections against the perfection of one, as
against the perfection of the other.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>II. It is obvious too, that in the Christian dispensation, as
much as in the natural scheme of things, means are made use of
to accomplish ends.</p>

<p>The observation of this furnishes us with the same answer, to
objections against the perfection of Christianity, as to objections
of the like kind, against the constitution of nature. It shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the credibility, that the things objected against, how <em>foolish</em><a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
soever they appear to men, may be the very best means of accomplishing
the very best ends. And their appearing <em>foolishness</em>
is no presumption against this, in a scheme so greatly beyond
our comprehension.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>III. The credibility, that the Christian dispensation may have
been, all along, carried on by general laws,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> no less than the
course of nature, may require to be more distinctly made out.</p>

<p>Consider then, upon <em>what ground</em> it is we say, that the whole
common course of nature is carried on according to general fore-ordained
laws. We know indeed several of the general laws of
matter; and a great part of the natural behavior of living agents
is reducible to general laws. But we know in a manner nothing,
by what laws, storms, tempests, earthquakes, famine, pestilence,
become the instruments of destruction to mankind. And the
laws by which persons born into the world at such a time and
place are of such capacities, geniuses, tempers; the laws by
which thoughts come into our mind, in a multitude of cases;
and by which innumerable things happen, of the greatest influence
upon the affairs and state of the world. These laws are so
wholly unknown to us, that we call the events which come to
pass by them, accidental; though all reasonable men know certainly,
that there cannot, in reality, be any such thing as chance;
and conclude that the things which have this appearance are the
result of general laws, and may be reduced to them. It is but
an exceeding little way, and in but a very few respects, that we
can trace up the natural course of things before us, to general
laws. It is only from analogy, that we conclude the whole of it
to be capable of being reduced to them: only from our seeing
that part is so. It is from our finding, that the course of nature,
in some respects and so far, goes on by general laws, that we conclude
this of the rest.</p>

<p>If that be a just ground for such a conclusion, it is a just
ground also, if not to conclude, yet to apprehend, to render it
supposable and credible, which is sufficient for answering objections,
that God’s miraculous interpositions may have been, all
along in like manner, by <em>general</em> laws of wisdom. Thus, that
miraculous powers should be exerted, at such times, upon such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
occasions, in such degrees and manners, and with regard to such
persons, rather than others; that the affairs of the world, being
permitted to go on in their natural course so far, should, just at
such a point, have a new direction given them by miraculous interpositions;
that these interpositions should be exactly in such
degrees and respects only; all this may have been by general
laws. These laws are indeed unknown to us: but no more unknown
than the laws from whence it is, that some die as soon as
they are born, and others live to extreme old age; that one man
is so superior to another in understanding; with innumerable
more things, which, as was before observed, we cannot reduce to
any laws or rules, though it is taken for granted, they are as
much reducible to general ones, as gravitation. If the revealed
dispensations of Providence, and miraculous interpositions, be
by general laws, as well as God’s ordinary government in the
course of nature, made known by reason and experience; there
is no more reason to expect that every exigence, as it arises,
should be provided for by these general laws or miraculous interpositions,
than that every exigence in nature should be, by the
general laws of nature. Yet there might be wise and good
reasons, why miraculous interpositions should be by general laws;
and why these laws should not be broken in upon, or deviated
from, by other miracles.</p>

<p>Upon the whole then, the appearance of deficiencies and irregularities
in nature is owing to its being a scheme but in part
made known, and of such a certain particular kind in other respects.
We see no more reason why the frame and course of
nature should be such a scheme, than why Christianity should.
And that the former is such a scheme, renders it credible, that
the latter, upon supposition of its truth, may be so too. And as
it is manifest, that Christianity is a scheme revealed but in part,
and a scheme in which means are made use of to accomplish
ends, like to that of nature: so the credibility, that it may have
been all along carried on by general laws, no less than the course
of nature, has been distinctly proved. From all this it is beforehand
credible that there might, I think probable that there
would, be the like appearance of deficiencies and irregularities
in Christianity, as in nature: <i>i.e.</i> that Christianity would be
liable to the like objections, as the frame of nature. And these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
objections are answered by these observations concerning Christianity;
as the like objections against the frame of nature are
answered by the like observations concerning the frame of
nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The objections against Christianity, considered as a matter of
fact,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> having, in general, been obviated in the preceding chapter;
and the same, considered as made against the wisdom and goodness
of it, having been obviated in this: the next thing, according
to the method proposed, is to show, that the principal objections,
in particular, against Christianity, may be answered, by
particular and full analogies in nature. And as one of them is
made against the whole scheme of it together, as just now described,
I choose to consider it here, rather than in a distinct
chapter by itself.</p>

<p>The thing objected against this scheme of the gospel is, “that
it seems to suppose God was reduced to the necessity of a long
series of intricate means, in order to accomplish his ends, the
recovery and salvation of the world: in like sort as men, for
want of understanding or power, not being able to come at their
ends directly, are forced to go roundabout ways, and make use
of many perplexed contrivances to arrive at them,” Now every
thing which we see shows the folly of this, considered as an objection
against the truth of Christianity. For, according to our
manner of conception, God makes use of variety of means, what
we often think tedious ones, in the natural course of providence,
for the accomplishment of all his ends. Indeed it is certain
there is somewhat in this matter quite beyond our comprehension:
but the mystery is as great in nature as in Christianity.
We know what we ourselves aim at, as final ends: and what
courses we take, merely as means conducing to those ends. But
we are greatly ignorant how far things are considered by the
Author of nature, under the single notion of means and ends;
so as that it may be said, this is merely an end, and that merely
a means, in his regard. And whether there be not some peculiar
absurdity in our very manner of conception, concerning this
matter, something contradictory arising from our extremely imperfect
views of things, it is impossible to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>However, this much is manifest, that the whole natural world
and government of it, is a scheme or system; not a fixed, but a
progressive one: a scheme in which the operation of various
means takes up a great length of time, before the ends they tend
to can be attained. The change of seasons, the ripening of
fruits, the very history of a flower, are instances of this: and so
is human life. Thus vegetable bodies, and those of animals,
though possibly formed at once, yet grow up by degrees to a
mature state. And thus rational agents, who animate these
latter bodies, are naturally directed to form each his own manners
and character, by the gradual gaining of knowledge and experience,
and by a long course of action. Our existence is not only
successive, as it must be of necessity; but one state of our life
and being is appointed by God, to be a preparation for another;
and that to be the means of attaining to another succeeding one:
infancy to childhood; childhood to youth; youth to mature age.
Men are impatient, and for precipitating things: but the Author
of nature appears deliberate throughout his operations; accomplishing
his natural ends by slow successive steps.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> And there
is a plan of things beforehand laid out, which, from the nature
of it, requires various systems of means, as well as length of
time, in order to the carrying on its several parts into execution.</p>

<p>Thus, in the daily course of natural providence, God operates
in the very same manner, as in the dispensation of Christianity;
making one thing subservient to another; this, to something
further; and so on, through a progressive series of means, which
extend, both backward and forward, beyond our utmost view.
Of this manner of operation, every thing we see in the course
of nature is as much an instance, as any part of the Christian
dispensation.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PARTICULAR SYSTEM OF CHRISTIANITY; THE APPOINTMENT
OF A MEDIATOR, AND THE REDEMPTION OF THE
WORLD BY HIM.</span></h3>

<p>There is not, I think, any thing relating to Christianity, which
has been more objected against, than the mediation of Christ, in
some or other of its parts. Yet upon thorough consideration,
there seems nothing less justly liable to it.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> For,</p>

<p>I. The whole analogy of nature removes all imagined presumption
against the general notion of <em>a Mediator between God and
man</em>.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> For we find all living creatures are brought into the
world, and their life in infancy is preserved, by the instrumentality
of others: and every satisfaction of it, some way or other, is
bestowed by the like means. So that the visible government,
which God exercises over the world, is by the instrumentality
and mediation of others. How far his invisible government be
or be not so, it is impossible to determine at all by reason. The
supposition, that part of it is so, appears, to say the least, altogether
as credible, as the contrary. There is then no sort of objection,
from the light of nature, against the general notion of a
mediator between God and man, considered as a doctrine of Christianity,
or as an appointment in this dispensation: since we find
by experience, that God does appoint mediators, to be the instruments
of good and evil to us: the instruments of his justice and
his mercy. And the objection here referred to is urged, not
against mediation in that high, eminent, and peculiar sense, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
which Christ is our mediator; but absolutely against the whole
notion itself of a mediator at all.</p>

<p>II. As we must suppose, that the world is under the proper
moral government of God, or in a state of religion, before we can
enter into consideration of the revealed doctrine, concerning the
redemption of it by Christ: so that supposition is here to be distinctly
noticed. Now the divine moral government which religion
teaches us, implies that the consequence of vice shall be
misery, in some future state, by the righteous judgment of God.
That such consequent punishment shall take effect by his appointment,
is necessarily implied. But, as it is not in any sort to be
supposed, that we are made acquainted with all the ends or
reasons, for which it is fit that future punishments should be inflicted,
or why God has appointed such and such consequent
misery to follow vice; and as we are altogether in the dark, how
or in what manner it shall follow, by what immediate occasions,
or by the instrumentality of what means; so there is no absurdity
in supposing it may follow in a way analogous to that in which
many miseries follow such and such courses of action at present;
poverty, sickness, infamy, untimely death by diseases, death from
the hands of civil justice. There is no absurdity in supposing
future punishment may follow wickedness <em>of course</em>, as we speak,
or in the way of natural consequence from God’s original constitution
of the world; from the nature he has given us, and from
the condition in which he places us; or in a like manner, as a
person rashly trifling upon a precipice, in the way of natural consequence,
falls down; in the way of natural consequence of this,
breaks his limbs, and in the way of natural consequence, without
help, perishes.</p>

<p>Some good men may perhaps be offended with hearing it spoken
of as a supposable thing that future punishments of wickedness
may be in the way of natural consequence: as if this were taking
the execution of justice out of the hands of God, and giving it to
nature. But they should remember, that when things come to
pass according to the course of nature, this does not hinder them
from being his doing, who is the God of nature: and that the
Scripture ascribes those punishments to divine justice, which are
known to be natural; and which must be called so, when distinguished
from such as are miraculous. After all, this supposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
or rather this way of speaking, is here made use of only
by way of illustration of the subject before us. For since it must
be admitted, that the future punishment of wickedness is not a
matter of arbitrary appointment, but of reason, equity, and justice;
it comes for aught I see, to the same thing, whether it is supposed
to be inflicted in a way analogous to that in which the
temporal punishments of vice and folly are inflicted, or in any
other way. And though there were a difference, it is allowable,
in the present case, to make this supposition, plainly not an incredible
one, that future punishment may follow wickedness in
the way of natural consequence, or according to some general
laws of government already established in the universe.</p>

<p>III. Upon this supposition, or even without it, we may observe
somewhat, much to the present purpose, in the constitution of
nature or appointments of Providence: the provision which is
made, that all the bad natural consequences of men’s actions
should not always actually follow; or that such bad consequences,
as, according to the settled course of things, would inevitably
have followed if not prevented, should, in certain degrees, be prevented.
We are apt presumptuously to imagine, that the world
might have been so constituted, as that there would not have
been any such thing as misery or evil. On the contrary we find
the Author of nature permits it: but then he has provided reliefs,
and in many cases perfect remedies for it, after some pains and
difficulties; reliefs and remedies even for that evil, which is the
fruit of our own misconduct; and which, in the course of nature,
would have continued, and ended in our destruction, but for such
remedies. And this is an instance both of severity and of indulgence,
in the constitution of nature. Thus all the bad consequences,
now mentioned, of a man’s trifling upon a precipice,
might be prevented. And though all were not, yet some of them
might, by proper interposition, if not rejected:<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> by another’s
coming to the rash man’s relief, with his own laying hold on that
relief, in such sort as the case required. Persons may do a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
deal themselves towards preventing the bad consequences of their
follies: and more may be done by themselves, together with the
assistance of others their fellow-creatures; which assistance nature
requires and prompts us to. This is the general constitution of
the world.</p>

<p>Now suppose it had been so constituted, that after such actions
were done, as were foreseen naturally to draw after them misery
to the doer, it should have been no more in human power to have
prevented that naturally consequent misery, in any instance, than
it is in all: no one can say, whether such a more severe constitution
of things might not yet have been really good. But, on the
contrary, provision being made by nature, that we may and do,
to so great degree, prevent the bad natural effects of our follies;
this may be called mercy or compassion in the original constitution
of the world: compassion, as distinguished from goodness in
general. And, the whole known constitution and course of things
affording us instances of such compassion, it would be according
to the analogy of nature, to hope, that however ruinous the
natural consequences of vice might be, from the general laws of
God’s government over the universe; yet provision might be
made, possibly might have been originally made, for preventing
those ruinous consequences from inevitably following: at least
from following universally, and in all cases.</p>

<p>Many, I am sensible, will wonder at finding this made a question,
or spoken of as in any degree doubtful. The generality of mankind
are so far from having that awful sense of things, which the
present state of vice and misery and darkness seems to make but
reasonable, that they have scarce any apprehension or thought at
all about this matter, any way: and some serious persons may
have spoken unadvisedly concerning it. But let us observe,
what we experience to be, and what, from the very constitution
of nature cannot but be, the consequences of irregular and disorderly
behavior: even of such rashness, wilfulness, neglects, as
we scarce call vicious. Now it is natural to apprehend, that the
bad consequences of irregularity will be greater, in proportion as
the irregularity is so. And there is no comparison between these
irregularities, and the greater instances of vice, or a dissolute
profligate disregard to all religion; if there be any thing at all in
religion. For consider what it is for creatures, moral agents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
presumptuously to introduce that confusion and misery into the
kingdom of God, which mankind have in fact introduced: to
blaspheme the Sovereign Lord of all; to contemn his authority;
to be injurious, to the degree they are, to their fellow-creatures,
the creatures of God. Add that the effects of vice in the present
world are often extreme misery, irretrievable ruin, and even
death: and upon putting all this together, it will appear, that as
no one can say, in what degree fatal the unprevented consequences
of vice may be, according to the general rule of divine government;
so it is by no means intuitively certain, how far these
consequences could possibly, in the nature of the thing, be prevented,
consistently with the eternal rule of right, or with what
is, in fact, the moral constitution of nature. However, there
would be large ground to hope, that the universal government
was not so severely strict, but that there was room for pardon, or
for having those penal consequences prevented. Yet,</p>

<p>IV. There seems no probability, that any thing we could do
would alone and of itself prevent them: prevent their following,
or being inflicted. But one would think at least, it were impossible
that the contrary should be thought certain. For we are
not acquainted with the whole of the case. We are not informed
of all the reasons, which render it fit that future punishments
should be inflicted: and therefore cannot know, whether any
thing we could do would make such an alteration, as to render it
fit that they should be remitted. We do not know what the
whole natural or appointed consequences of vice are; nor in what
way they would follow, if not prevented: and therefore can in no
sort say, whether we could do any thing which would be sufficient
to prevent them. Our ignorance being thus manifest, let us
recollect the analogy of nature or Providence. For, though this
may be but a slight ground to raise a positive opinion upon, in
this matter; yet it is sufficient to answer a mere arbitrary assertion,
without any kind of evidence, urged by way of objection
against a doctrine, the proof of which is not reason, but revelation.
Consider then: people ruin their fortunes by extravagance;
they bring diseases upon themselves by excess; they incur the
penalties of civil laws; and surely civil government is natural;
will sorrow for these follies past, and behaving well for the future,
alone and of itself prevent the natural consequences of them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
On the contrary, men’s natural abilities of helping themselves
are often impaired; or if not, yet they are forced to be beholden
to the assistance of others, upon several accounts, and in different
ways; assistance which they would have had no occasion for,
had it not been for their misconduct; but which, in the disadvantageous
condition they have reduced themselves to, is absolutely
necessary to their recovery, and retrieving their affairs.
Since this is our case, considering ourselves merely as inhabitants
of this world, and as having a temporal interest here, under the
natural government of God, which however has a great deal
moral in it; why is it not supposable that this may be our case
also, in our more important capacity, as under his perfect moral
government, and having a more general and future interest
depending?<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> If we have misbehaved in this higher capacity,
and rendered ourselves obnoxious to the future punishment,
which God has annexed to vice: it is plainly credible, that
behaving well for the time to come may be&mdash;not useless, God
forbid&mdash;but wholly insufficient, alone and of itself, to prevent
that punishment: or to put us in the condition which we should
have been in, had we preserved our innocence.</p>

<p>Though we ought to reason with all reverence, whenever we
reason concerning the divine conduct: yet it may be added, that
it is clearly contrary to all our notions of government, as well as
to what is, in fact, the general constitution of nature, to suppose,
that doing well for the future should, in all cases, prevent all the
judicial bad consequences of having done evil, or all the punishment
annexed to disobedience. We have manifestly nothing
from whence to determine, in what degree, and in what cases,
reformation would prevent this punishment, even supposing that
it would in some. And though the efficacy of repentance itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
alone, to prevent what mankind had rendered themselves obnoxious
to, and recover what they had forfeited, is now insisted
upon, in opposition to Christianity; yet, by the general prevalence
of propitiatory sacrifices over the heathen world, this notion
of repentance alone being sufficient to expiate guilt, appears to
be contrary to the general sense of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Upon the whole then; had the laws, the general laws of God’s
government been permitted to operate, without any interposition
in our behalf, the future punishment, for aught we know to
the contrary, or have any reason to think, must inevitably have
followed, notwithstanding any thing we could have done to prevent
it.</p>

<p>V. In this darkness, or this light of nature, call it which you
please, revelation comes in; and confirms every doubting fear,
which could enter into the heart of man, concerning the future
unprevented consequence of wickedness. It supposes the world
to be in a state of ruin (a supposition which seems the very
ground of the Christian dispensation; and which, if not provable
by reason, yet is in no wise contrary to it;) and teaches us too,
that the rules of divine government are such, as not to admit of
pardon immediately and directly upon repentance, or by the sole
efficacy of it. But teaches at the same time, what nature might
justly have hoped, that the moral government of the universe
was not so rigid, but that there was room for an interposition, to
avert the fatal consequences of vice; which therefore, by this
means, does admit of pardon. Revelation teaches us, that the
unknown laws of God’s more general government, no less than
the particular laws by which we experience he governs us at
present, are compassionate,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> as well as good in the more general
notion of goodness: and that he hath mercifully provided, that
there should be an interposition to prevent the destruction of
human kind; whatever that destruction unprevented would have
been. <cite>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth</cite>, not, to be sure, in a speculative,
but in a practical sense, <em>that whosoever believeth in him, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
not perish</em>:<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> gave his Son in the same way of goodness to the
world, as he affords particular persons the friendly assistance of
their fellow-creatures, when, without it, their temporal ruin would
be the certain consequence of their follies: in the same way of
goodness, I say, though in a transcendent and infinitely higher
degree. And the Son of God <cite>loved us, and gave himself for us</cite>,
with a love, which he himself compares to that of human friendship:
though, in this case, all comparisons must fall infinitely
short of the thing intended to be illustrated by them. He interposed
in such a manner as was necessary and effectual to prevent
that execution of justice upon sinners, which God had appointed
should otherwise have been executed upon them; or in such a
manner, as to prevent that punishment from actually following,
which, according to the general laws of divine government, must
have followed the sins of the world, had it not been for such
interposition.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>If any thing here said should appear, upon first thought, inconsistent
with divine goodness; a second, I am persuaded, will
entirely remove that appearance. For were we to suppose the
constitution of things to be such, as that the whole creation must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
have perished, had it not been for something, which God had
appointed should be, in order to prevent that ruin: even this
supposition would not be inconsistent, in any degree, with the
most absolutely perfect goodness. Still it may be thought, that
this whole manner of treating the subject before us supposes
mankind to be naturally in a very strange state. And truly so
it does. But it is not Christianity which has put us into this
state. Whoever will consider the manifold miseries, and the
extreme wickedness of the world; that the best have great
wrongnesses within themselves, which they complain of, and
endeavor to amend; but that the generality grow more profligate
and corrupt with age; that even moralists thought the present
state to be a state of punishment: and, that the earth our habitation
has the appearances of being a ruin: whoever, I say, will
consider all these, and some other obvious things, will think he
has little reason to object against the Scripture account, that
mankind is in a state of degradation; against this being <em>the
fact</em>: how difficult soever he may think it to account for, or even
to form a distinct conception of the occasions and circumstances
of it. But that the crime of our first parents was the occasion
of our being placed in a more disadvantageous condition, is a
thing throughout and particularly analogous to what we see in
the daily course of natural providence; as the recovery of the
world by the interposition of Christ has been shown to be so in
general.</p>

<p>VI. The particular manner in which Christ interposed in the
redemption of the world, or his office as <em>Mediator</em>, in the largest
sense, <em>between God and man</em>, is thus represented to us in the
Scripture. <cite>He is the light of the world</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the revealer of the
will of God in the most eminent sense. He is a propitiatory
sacrifice;<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> <cite>the Lamb of God</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and, as he voluntarily offered
himself up, he is styled our High Priest.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> And, which seems
of peculiar weight, he is described beforehand in the Old Testament,
under the same characters of a priest, and an expiatory
victim.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And whereas it is objected, that all this is merely by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
way of allusion to the sacrifices of the Mosaic law, the Apostle
on the contrary affirms, that the <cite>law was a shadow of good things
to come, and not the very image of the things</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and that <cite>the
priests that offer gifts according to the law&mdash;serve unto the example
and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished
of God, when he was about to make the tabernacle. For see,
saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern
showed to thee in the mount</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> <i>i.e.</i> the Levitical priesthood was a
shadow of the priesthood of Christ; in like manner as the tabernacle
made by Moses was according to that showed him in the
mount. The priesthood of Christ, and the tabernacle in the
mount, were the originals; of the former of which the Levitical
priesthood was a type; and of the latter the tabernacle made by
Moses was a copy. The doctrine of this epistle then plainly is,
that the legal sacrifices were allusions to the great and final
atonement to be made by the blood of Christ; and not that this
was an allusion to those. Nor can any thing be more express
and determinate than the following passage. <cite>It is not possible
that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin.
Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
and offering</cite>, <i>i.e.</i> of bulls and of goats, <cite>thou wouldest not, but a
body hast thou prepared me. Lo! I come to do thy will, O God.
By which will we are sanctified., through the offering of the body
of Jesus Christ once for all.</cite><a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> And to add one passage more of
the like kind: <cite>Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many:
and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time,
without sin</cite>; <i>i.e.</i> without bearing sin, as he did at his first
coming, by being an offering for it; without having our <cite>iniquities</cite>
again <cite>laid upon him</cite>, without being any more a sin-offering:&mdash;<cite>unto
them, that look for him shall he appear the second time,
without sin, unto salvation</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Nor do the inspired writers at all
confine themselves to this manner of speaking concerning the
satisfaction of Christ; but declare an efficacy in what he did and
suffered for us, additional to and beyond mere instruction, example,
and government, in great variety of expression: <cite>That
Jesus should die for that nation</cite>, the Jews: <cite>and not for that
nation only, but that also</cite>, plainly by the efficacy of his death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<cite>he should gather together in one the children of God that were
scattered abroad</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> that <cite>he suffered for sins, the just for the unjust</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
that <cite>he gave his life, himself, a ransom</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> that <cite>we are
bought, bought with a price</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> that <cite>he redeemed us with his
blood: redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> that he is our <cite>advocate</cite>, <cite>intercessor</cite>, and <cite>propitiation</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
that <cite>he was made perfect</cite>, or consummate, <cite>through sufferings;
and being</cite> thus <cite>made perfect, he became the author of salvation</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
that <cite>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself;
by the death of his Son, by the cross; not imputing their
trespasses unto them</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and lastly, that <cite>through death he destroyed
him that had the power of death</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Christ having thus <cite>humbled
himself, and become obedient to death, even the death of the cross;
God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which
is above every name: hath given all things into his hands: hath
committed all judgment unto him; that all men should honor the
Son, even as they honor the Father</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> For, <cite>worthy is the Lamb
that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. And every creature
which is in heaven, and on the earth, heard I, saying, Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth
upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</cite><a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>These passages of Scripture seem to comprehend and express
the chief parts of Christ’s office, as Mediator between God and
man, so far, I mean, as the nature of this his office is revealed;
and it is usually treated of by divines under three heads.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, He was, by way of eminence, the Prophet: <cite>that Prophet
that should come into the world</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> to declare the divine
will. He published anew the law of nature, which men had
corrupted; and the very knowledge of which, to some degree,
was lost among them. He taught mankind, taught us authoritatively,
to <cite>live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world</cite>,
in expectation of the future judgment of God. He confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the truth of this moral system of nature, and gave us additional
evidence of it; the evidence of testimony.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> He distinctly
revealed the manner, in which God would be worshipped, the
efficacy of repentance, and the rewards and punishments of a
future life. Thus he was a prophet in a sense in which no other
ever was. To which is to be added, that he set us a perfect <cite>example,
that we should follow his steps</cite>.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, He has a <cite>kingdom which is not of this world</cite>. He
founded a Church, to be to mankind a standing memorial of
religion, and invitation to it; which he promised to be with
always even to the end. He exercises an invisible government
over it, himself, and by his Spirit: over that part of it which is
militant here on earth, a government of discipline, <cite>for the perfecting
of the saints, for the edifying his body: till we all come
in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
fulness of Christ</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Of this Church, all persons scattered over
the world, who live in obedience to his laws, are members. For
these he is <cite>gone to prepare a place, and will come again to receive
them unto himself, that where he is, there they may be also;
and reign with him forever and ever</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and likewise <cite>to take
vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not his
Gospel</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Against these parts of Christ’s office I find no objections, but
what are fully obviated in the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, Christ offered himself a propitiatory sacrifice, and
made atonement for the sins of the world; which is mentioned
last, in regard to what is objected against it. Sacrifices of expiation
were commanded the Jews, and obtained among most other
nations, from tradition, whose original probably was revelation.
And they were continually repeated, both occasionally, and at the
returns of stated times: and made up great part of the external
religion of mankind. <cite>But now once in the end of the world
Christ appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</cite><a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
This sacrifice was, in the highest degree and with the most extensive
influence, of that efficacy for obtaining pardon of sin,
which the heathens may be supposed to have thought their sacrifices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to have been, and which the Jewish sacrifices really were
in some degree, and with regard to some persons.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>How and in what particular <em>way</em> it had this efficacy, there are
not wanting persons who have endeavored to explain: but I do
not find that the Scripture has explained it. We seem to be
very much in the dark concerning the manner in which the
ancients understood atonement to be made, <i>i.e.</i> pardon to be
obtained by sacrifices. And if the Scripture has, as surely it
has, left this matter of the satisfaction of Christ mysterious, left
somewhat in it unrevealed, all conjectures about it must be, if
not evidently absurd, yet at least uncertain. Nor has any one
reason to complain for want of further information, unless he can
show his claim to it.</p>

<p>Some have endeavored to explain the efficacy of what Christ
has done and suffered for us, beyond what the Scripture has
authorized: others, probably because they could not explain it,
have been for taking it away, and confining his office as Redeemer
of the world, to his instruction, example, and government
of the church. Whereas the doctrine of the Gospel appears to
be, not only that he taught the efficacy of repentance, but rendered
it of the efficacy of which it is, by what he did and
suffered for us: that he obtained for us the benefit of having our
repentance accepted unto eternal life: not only that he revealed
to sinners, that they were in a capacity of salvation, and how
they might obtain it; but moreover that he put them into this
capacity of salvation, by what he did and suffered for them; put
us into a capacity of escaping future punishment, and obtaining
future happiness. And it is our wisdom thankfully to accept
the benefit, by performing the conditions, upon which it is
offered, on our part, without disputing how it was procured on
his. For,</p>

<p>VII. Since we neither know by what means punishment in a
future state would have followed wickedness in this: nor in what
manner it would have been inflicted, had it not been prevented;
nor all the reasons why its infliction would have been needful,
nor the particular nature of that state of happiness, which Christ
is gone to prepare for his disciples: and since we are ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
how far any thing which we could do, would, alone and of itself,
have been effectual to prevent that punishment to which we were
obnoxious, and recover that happiness which we had forfeited;
it is most evident we are not judges, antecedently to revelation,
whether a mediator was or was not necessary, to obtain those
ends: to prevent that future punishment, and bring mankind to
the final happiness of their nature. For the very same reasons,
upon supposition of the necessity of a mediator, we are no more
judges, antecedently to revelation, of the whole nature of his
office, or of the several parts of which it consists; or of what was
fit and requisite to be assigned him, in order to accomplish the
ends of divine Providence in the appointment. Hence it follows,
that to object against the expediency or usefulness of particular
things, revealed to have been done or suffered by him, because
we do not see how they were conducive to those ends, is highly
absurd. Yet nothing is more common to be met with, than this
absurdity. If it be acknowledged beforehand, that we are not
judges in the case, it is evident that no objection can, with any
shadow of reason, be urged against any particular part of Christ’s
mediatorial office revealed in Scripture, till it can be shown positively
not to be requisite or conducive to the ends proposed to be
accomplished; or that it is in itself unreasonable.</p>

<p>There is one objection made against the satisfaction of Christ,
which looks to be of this positive kind: that the doctrine of his
being appointed to suffer for the sins of the world, represents
God as being indifferent whether he punished the innocent or
the guilty. Now from the foregoing observations we may see
the extreme slightness of all such objections; and (though it is
most certain all who make them <em>do not see</em> the consequence) that
they conclude altogether as much against God’s whole original
constitution of nature, and the whole daily course of divine Providence
in the government of the world, (<i>i.e.</i> against the whole
scheme of Theism and the whole notion of religion,) as against
Christianity. For the world is a constitution or system, whose
parts have a mutual reference to each other: and there is a
scheme of things gradually carrying on, called the course of nature,
to the carrying on of which God has appointed us, in various
ways, to contribute. And when, in the daily course of natural
providence, it is appointed that innocent people should suffer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the faults of the guilty, this is liable to the very same objection,
as the instance we are now considering. The infinitely greater
importance of that appointment of Christianity, which is objected
against, does not hinder but it may be, as it plainly is, an appointment
of the very same <em>kind</em>, with what the world affords us
daily examples of. Nay, if there were any force at all in the objection,
it would be stronger, in one respect, against natural
providence, than against Christianity: because under the former
we are in many cases commanded, and even necessitated whether
we will or no, to suffer for the faults of others; whereas the sufferings
of Christ were voluntary.</p>

<p>The world’s being under the righteous government of God
does indeed imply, that finally, and upon the whole, every one
shall receive according to his personal deserts: and the general
doctrine of the whole Scripture is, that this shall be the completion
of the divine government. But during the progress, and,
for aught we know, even in order to the completion of this moral
scheme, vicarious punishments may be fit, and absolutely necessary.
Men by their follies run themselves into extreme distress;
into difficulties which would be absolutely fatal to them, were it
not for the interposition and assistance of others. God commands
by the law of nature, that we afford them this assistance, in many
cases where we cannot do it without very great pains, and labor,
and sufferings to ourselves. We see in what variety of ways one
person’s sufferings contribute to the relief of another: and how,
or by what particular means, this comes to pass, or follows, from
the constitution and laws of nature, which came under our notice:
and, being familiarized to it, men are not shocked with it. So
that the reason of their insisting upon objections of the foregoing
kind against the satisfaction of Christ is, either that they do not
consider God’s settled and uniform appointments as his appointments
at all; or else they forget that vicarious punishment is a
providential appointment of every day’s experience. And then,
from their being unacquainted with the more general laws of
nature or divine government over the world, and not seeing how
the sufferings of Christ could contribute to the redemption of it,
unless by arbitrary and tyrannical will, they conclude his sufferings
could not contribute to it any other way. And yet, what
has been often alleged in justification of this doctrine, even from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the apparent natural tendency of this method of our redemption;
its tendency to vindicate the authority of God’s laws, and deter
his creatures from sin; this has never yet been answered, and is
I think plainly unanswerable: though I am far from thinking it
an account of the whole of the case. But, without taking this
into consideration, it abundantly appears, from the observations
above made, that this objection is not an objection against Christianity,
but against the whole general constitution of nature.
And if it were to be considered as an objection against Christianity,
or considering it as it is, an objection against the constitution
of nature; it amounts to no more in conclusion than this,
that a divine appointment cannot be necessary or expedient, because
the objector does not discern it to be so: though he must
own that the nature of the case is such, as renders him incapable
of judging, whether it be so or not; or of seeing it to be necessary,
though it were so!</p>

<p>It is indeed a matter of great patience to reasonable men, to
find people arguing in this manner: objecting against the credibility
of such particular things revealed in Scripture, that they
do not see the necessity or expediency of them. For though it
is highly right, and the most pious exercise of our understanding,
to inquire with due reverence into the ends and reasons of God’s
dispensations: yet when those reasons are concealed, to argue from
our ignorance, that such dispensations cannot be from God, is infinitely
absurd. The presumption of this kind of objections
seems almost lost in the folly of them. And the folly of them
is yet greater, when they are urged, as usually they are, against
things in Christianity analogous or like to those natural dispensations
of Providence, which are matter of experience. Let reason
be kept to: and if any part of the Scripture account of the redemption
of the world by Christ can be shown to be really contrary
to it, let the Scripture, in the name of God, be given up.
But let not such poor creatures as we are, go on objecting against
an infinite scheme, that we do not see the necessity or usefulness
of all its parts, and call this reasoning; and, which still further
heightens the absurdity in the present case, parts which we are
not actively concerned in. For it may be worth mentioning,</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, That not only the reason of the thing, but the whole
analogy of nature, should teach us, not to expect to have the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
information concerning the divine conduct, as concerning our
own duty. God instructs us by experience, (for it is not reason,
but experience which instructs us,) what good or bad consequences
will follow from our acting in such and such manners:
and by this he directs us how we are to behave ourselves. But,
though we are sufficiently instructed for the common purposes of
life: yet it is but an almost infinitely small part of natural providence,
which we are at all let into. The case is the same with
regard to revelation. The doctrine of a mediator between God
and man, against which it is objected, that the expediency of
some things in it is not understood, relates only to what was done
on God’s part in the appointment, and on the Mediator’s in the
execution of it. For what is <em>required of us</em>, in consequence of
this gracious dispensation, is another subject, in which none can
complain for want of information. The constitution of the world,
and God’s natural government over it, is all mystery, as much as
the Christian dispensation. Yet under the first he has given
men all things pertaining to life; and under the other all things
pertaining unto godliness. And it may be added, that there is
nothing hard to be accounted for in any of the common precepts
of Christianity: though if there were, surely a divine command
is abundantly sufficient to lay us under the strongest obligations
to obedience. But the fact is, that the reasons of all the Christian
precepts are evident. Positive institutions are manifestly
necessary to keep up and propagate religion among mankind.
And our duty to Christ, the internal and external worship of
him; this part of the religion of the Gospel manifestly arises
out of what he has done and suffered, his authority and
dominion, and the relation which he is revealed to stand in
to us.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WANT OF UNIVERSALITY IN REVELATION; AND THE
SUPPOSED DEFICIENCY IN THE PROOF OF IT.</span></h3>

<p>It has been thought by some persons, that if the evidence of
revelation appears doubtful, this itself turns into a positive argument
against it: because it cannot be supposed, that, if it were
true, it would be left to subsist upon doubtful evidence. And
the objection against revelation from its not being universal is
often insisted upon as of great weight.</p>

<p>The weakness of these opinions may be shown, by observing
the suppositions on which they are founded: which are really
such as these; that it cannot be thought God would have bestowed
any favor at all upon us, unless in the degree which we
think he might, and which, we imagine, would be most to our
particular advantage; and also that it cannot be thought he
would bestow a favor upon any, unless he bestowed the same
upon all; suppositions, which we find contradicted, not by a few
instances in God’s natural government of the world, but by the
general analogy of nature together.</p>

<p>Persons who speak of the evidence of religion as doubtful,
and of this supposed doubtfulness as a positive argument against
it, should be put upon considering, what that evidence is, which
they act upon with regard to their temporal interests. It is not
only extremely difficult, but in many cases absolutely impossible,
to balance pleasure and pain, satisfaction and uneasiness, so as to
be able to say on which side is the overplus. There are the like
difficulties and impossibilities in making the due allowances for a
change of temper and taste, for satiety, disgusts, ill health: any
of which render men incapable of enjoying, after they have obtained
what they most eagerly desired. Numberless too are the
accidents, besides that one of untimely death, which may even
probably disappoint the best-concerted schemes: and strong
objections are often seen to lie against them, not to be removed
or answered, but which seem overbalanced by reasons on the
other side; so as that the certain difficulties and dangers of the
pursuit are, by every one; thought justly disregarded, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
account of the appearing greater advantages in case of success,
though there be but little probability of it. Lastly, every one
observes our liableness, if we be not upon our guard, to be
deceived by the falsehood of men, and the false appearances of
things: and this danger must be greatly increased, if there be a
strong bias within, suppose from indulged passion, to favor the
deceit. Hence arises that great uncertainty and doubtfulness of
proof, <em>wherein</em> our temporal interest really consists; what are the
most probable <em>means</em> of attaining it; and whether those means
will eventually be <em>successful</em>. And numberless instances there
are, in the daily course of life, in which all men think it reasonable
to engage in pursuits, though the probability is greatly
against succeeding; and to make such provision for themselves,
as it is supposable they may have occasion for, though the plain
acknowledged probability is, that they never shall.</p>

<p>Those who think the objection against revelation, from its light
not being universal, to be of weight,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> should observe, that the
Author of nature, in numberless instances, bestows that upon
some, which he does not upon others, who seem equally to stand
in need of it. Indeed he appears to bestow all his gifts with the
most promiscuous variety among creatures of the same species:
health and strength, capacities of prudence and of knowledge,
means of improvement, riches, and all external advantages. As
there are not any two men found, of exactly like shape and
features; so it is probable there are not any two, of an exactly
like constitution, temper, and situation, with regard to the goods
and evils of life. Yet, notwithstanding these uncertainties and
varieties, God does exercise a natural government over the world;
and there is such a thing as a prudent and imprudent institution
of life, with regard to our health and our affairs, under that his
natural government.</p>

<p>As neither the Jewish nor Christian revelation have been universal;
and as they have been afforded to a greater or less part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the world, at different times; so likewise at different times,
both revelations have had different degrees of evidence. The
Jews who lived during the succession of prophets, that is, from
Moses till after the Captivity, had higher evidence of the truth
of their religion, than those had, who lived in the interval between
the last-mentioned period, and the coming of Christ. And
the first Christians had higher evidence of the miracles wrought
in attestation of Christianity, than what we have now. They
had also a strong presumptive proof of the truth of it, perhaps
of much greater force, in way of argument, than many think, of
which we have very little remaining; I mean the presumptive
proof of its truth, from the influence which it had upon the lives
of the generality of its professors. And we, or future ages, may
possibly have a proof of it, which they could not have, from the
conformity between the prophetic history, and the state of the
world<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and of Christianity.</p>

<p>And further: if we were to suppose the evidence, which some
have of religion, to amount to little more than seeing that it <em>may</em>
be true; but that they remain in great doubts and uncertainties
about both its evidence and its nature, and great perplexities concerning
the rule of life: others to have a <em>full conviction</em> of the
truth of religion, with a distinct knowledge of their duty; and
others severally to have all the intermediate degrees of religious
light and evidence, which lie between these two&mdash;if we put the
case, that for the present, it was intended that revelation should be
no more than a small light, in the midst of a world greatly overspread,
notwithstanding it, with ignorance and darkness: that
certain glimmerings of this light should extend, and be directed,
to remote distances, in such a manner as that those who really
partook of it should not discern whence it originally came: that
some in a nearer situation to it should have its light obscured,
and, in different ways and degrees, intercepted: and that others
should be placed within its clearer influence, and be much more
enlivened, cheered, and directed by it; but yet that even to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
it should be no more than a <em>light shining in a dark place</em>: all
this would be perfectly uniform, and of a piece with the conduct
of Providence, in the distribution of its other blessings. If the
fact of the case really were, that some have received no light at
all from the Scripture; as many ages and countries in the heathen
world: that others, though they have, by means of it, had essential
or natural religion enforced upon their consciences, yet have
never had the genuine Scripture revelation, with its real evidence,
proposed to their consideration; and the ancient Persians and
modern Mahometans may possibly be instances of people in a
situation somewhat like to this; that others, though they have
had the Scripture laid before them as of divine revelation, yet
have had it with the system and evidence of Christianity so interpolated,
the system so corrupted, the evidence so blended with
false miracles, as to leave the mind in the utmost doubtfulness
and uncertainty about the whole; which may be the state of
some thoughtful men, in most of those nations who call themselves
Christian: and lastly, that others have had Christianity
offered to them in its genuine simplicity, and with its proper
evidence, as persons in countries and churches of civil and of
Christian liberty; but that even these persons are left in great
ignorance in many respects, and have by no means light afforded
them enough to satisfy their curiosity, but only to regulate their
life, to teach them their duty, and encourage them in the careful
discharge of it. I say, if we were to suppose this somewhat of
a general true account of the degrees of moral and religious light
and evidence, which were intended to be afforded mankind, and
of what has actually been and is their situation, in their moral
and religious capacity; there would be nothing in all this ignorance,
doubtfulness, and uncertainty, in all these varieties, and
supposed disadvantages of some in comparison of others, respecting
religion, but may be paralleled by manifest analogies in the
natural dispensations of Providence at present, considering ourselves
merely in our temporal capacity.</p>

<p>Nor is there any thing shocking in all this, or which would
seem to bear hard upon the moral administration in nature, if we
would really keep in mind, that every one shall be dealt equitably
with: instead of forgetting this, or explaining it away, after it is
acknowledged in words. All shadow of injustice, and indeed all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
harsh appearances, in this various economy of Providence, would
be lost, if we would keep in mind, that every merciful allowance
shall be made, and no more be required of any one, than what
might have been equitably expected of him, from the circumstances
in which he was placed; and not what might have been
expected, had he been placed in other circumstances: <i>i.e.</i> in
Scripture language, that every man shall be <em>accepted according
to what he had, not according to what he had not</em>.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> This however
does not by any means imply, that all persons’ condition
here is equally advantageous with respect to futurity. And
Providence’s designing to place some in greater darkness with
respect to religious knowledge, is no more a reason why they
should not endeavor to get out of that darkness, and others to
bring them out of it, than why ignorant and slow people in
matters of other knowledge should not endeavor to learn, or
should not be instructed.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable to suppose, that the same wise and good
principle, whatever it was, which disposed the Author of nature
to make different kinds and orders of creatures, disposed him also
to place creatures of like kinds in different situations. And that
the same principle which disposed him to make creatures of
different moral capacities, disposed him also to place creatures of
like moral capacities in different religious situations; and even
the same creatures, in different periods of their being. The account
or reason of this is also most probably the account why the
constitution of things is such, as that creatures of moral natures
or capacities, for a considerable part of that duration in which
they are living agents, are not at all subjects of morality and religion;
but grow up to be so, and grow up to be so more and more,
gradually from childhood to mature age.</p>

<p>What, in particular, is the account or reason of these things,
we must be greatly in the dark, were it only that we know so
very little even of our own case. Our present state may possibly
be the consequence of something past, of which we are wholly
ignorant: as it has a reference to somewhat to come, of which
we know scarce any more than is necessary for practice. A
system or constitution, in its notion, implies variety; and so
complicated a one as this world, very great variety. So that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
were revelation universal, yet, from men’s different capacities of
understanding, from the different lengths of their lives, their
different educations and other external circumstances, and from
their difference of temper and bodily constitution, their religious
situations would be widely different, and the disadvantage of some
in comparison of others, perhaps, altogether as much as at present.
The true account, whatever it be, why mankind, or such a part
of mankind, are placed in this condition of ignorance, must be
supposed also the true account of our further ignorance, in not
knowing the reasons why, or whence it is, that they are placed
in this condition.</p>

<p>The following practical reflections may deserve the serious consideration
of those persons, who think the circumstances of mankind
or their own, in the forementioned respects, a ground of
complaint.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, The evidence of religion not appearing obvious, may
constitute one particular part of some men’s trial in the religious
sense: as it gives scope, for a virtuous exercise, or vicious neglect
of their understanding, in examining or not examining into that
evidence. There seems no possible reason to be given, why we
may not be in a state of moral probation, with regard to the exercise
of our understanding upon the subject of religion, as we are
with regard to our behavior in common affairs. The former is as
much a thing within our power and choice as the latter. And I
suppose it is to be laid down for certain, that the same character,
the same inward principle, which, after a man is convinced of
the truth of religion, renders him obedient to the precepts of it,
would, were he not thus convinced, set him about an examination
of it, upon its system and evidence being offered to his thoughts:
and that in the latter state his examination would be with an
impartiality, seriousness, and solicitude, proportionable to what
his obedience is in the former. And as inattention, negligence,
want of all serious concern, about a matter of such a nature and
such importance, when offered to men’s consideration, is, before
a distinct conviction of its truth, as real depravity and dissoluteness,
as neglect of religious practice after such conviction: so
active solicitude about it, and fair impartial consideration of its
evidence before such conviction, is as really an exercise of a
morally right temper; as is religious practice after. Thus, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
religion is not intuitively true, but a matter of deduction and
inference; that a conviction of its truth is not forced upon every
one, but left to be, by some, collected with heedful attention to
premises; this as much constitutes religious probation, as much
affords sphere, scope, opportunity, for right and wrong behavior,
as any thing whatever does. And their manner of treating this
subject, when laid before them, shows what is in their heart, and
is an exertion of it.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, It appears to be a thing as evident, though it is not
so much attended to, that if, upon consideration of religion, the
evidence of it should seem to any persons doubtful, in the highest
supposable degree; even this doubtful evidence will, however,
put them into a <em>general state of probation</em> in the moral and religious
sense. For, suppose a man to be really in doubt, whether
such a person had not done him the greatest favor; or, whether
his whole temporal interest did not depend upon that person; no
one, who had any sense of gratitude and of prudence, could
possibly consider himself in the same situation, with regard to
such person, as if he had no such doubt. In truth, it is as just
to say, that certainty and doubt are the same, as to say the situations
now mentioned would leave a man as entirely at liberty in
point of gratitude or prudence, as he would be, were he certain
he had received no favor from such person; or that he no way
depended upon him. Thus, though the evidence of religion
which is afforded to some men should be little more than they
are given to see, the system of Christianity, or religion in general,
to be supposable and credible; this ought in all reason to beget a
serious practical apprehension, that it <em>may</em> be true. And even
this will afford matter of exercise for religious suspense and deliberation,
for moral resolution and self-government; because the
apprehension that religion may be true does as really lay men
under obligations, as a full conviction that it is true. It gives
occasion and motives to consider further the important subject;
to preserve attentively upon their minds a general implicit sense
that they may be under divine moral government, an awful solicitude
about religion, whether natural or revealed. Such apprehension
ought to turn men’s eyes to every degree of new light
which may be had, from whatever side it comes; and induce
them to refrain, in the mean time, from all immoralities, and live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in the conscientious practice of every common virtue. Especially
are they bound to keep at the greatest distance from all dissolute
profaneness, for this the very nature of the case forbids; and to
treat with highest reverence a matter, upon which their own
whole interest and being, and the fate of nature, depend. This
behavior, and an active endeavor to maintain within themselves
this temper, is the business, the duty, and the wisdom of those
persons, who complain of the doubtfulness of religion: is what
they are under the most proper obligations to. And such behavior
is an exertion of, and has a tendency to improve in them,
that character, which the practice of all the several duties of religion,
from a full conviction of its truth, is an exertion of, and
has a tendency to improve in others: others, I say, to whom God
has afforded such conviction. Nay, considering the infinite importance
of religion, revealed as well as natural, I think it may
be said in general, that whoever will weigh the matter thoroughly
may see, there is not near so much difference, as is commonly
imagined, between what ought in reason to be the rule of life, to
those persons who are fully convinced of its truth, and to those
who have only a serious doubting apprehension, that it may be
true. Their hopes, and fears, and obligations, will be in various
degrees: but, as the subject-matter of their hopes and fears is
the same, so the subject-matter of their obligations, what they
are bound to do and to refrain from, is not so very unlike.</p>

<p>It is to be observed further, that, from a character of understanding,
or a situation of influence in the world, some persons
have it in their power to do infinitely more harm or good, by
setting an example of profaneness and avowed disregard to all
religion, or, on the contrary, of a serious, though perhaps doubting,
apprehension of its truth, and of a reverent regard to it
under this doubtfulness; than they can do, by acting well or ill
in all the <em>common intercourses</em> among mankind. Consequently
they are most highly accountable for a behavior, which, they may
easily foresee, is of such importance, and in which there is most
plainly a right and a wrong; even admitting the evidence of religion
to be as doubtful as is pretended.</p>

<p>The ground of these observations, and that which renders them
just and true, is, that doubting necessarily implies <em>some</em> degree
of evidence for that, of which we doubt. For no person would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
be in doubt concerning the truth of a number of facts so and so
circumstanced, which should accidentally come into his thoughts,
and of which he had no evidence at all. And though in the
case of an even chance, and where consequently we were in
doubt, we should in common language say, that we had no evidence
at all for either side; yet that situation of things, which
renders it an even chance and no more, that such an event will
happen, renders this case equivalent to all others, where there is
such evidence on both sides of a question,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> as leaves the mind in
doubt concerning the truth. Indeed in all these cases, there is
no more evidence on one side than on the other; but there is
(what is equivalent to) much more for either, than for the truth
of a number of facts, which come into one’s thoughts at random.
Thus, in all these cases, doubt as much presupposes evidence, in
lower degrees, as belief presupposes higher, and certainty higher
still. Any one, who will a little attend to the nature of evidence,
will easily carry this observation on, and see, that between no
evidence at all, and that degree of it which affords ground of
doubt, there are as many intermediate degrees, as there are, between
that degree which is the ground of doubt, and demonstration.
And though we have not faculties to distinguish these
degrees of evidence with any sort of exactness; yet, in proportion
as they are discerned, they ought to influence our practice. It
is as real an imperfection in the moral character, not to be influenced
in practice by a lower degree of evidence when discerned,
as it is in the understanding, not to discern it. And as, in all
subjects which men consider, they discern the lower as well as
higher degrees of evidence, proportionably to their capacity of
understanding; so, in practical subjects, they are influenced in
practice, by the lower as well as higher degrees of it, proportionably
to their fairness and honesty. And as, in proportion to defects
in the understanding, men are unapt to see lower degrees
of evidence, are in danger of overlooking evidence when it is not
glaring, and are easily imposed upon in such cases; so, in proportion
to the corruption of the heart, they seem capable of satisfying
themselves with having no regard in practice to evidence
acknowledged to be real, if it be not overbearing. From these
things it must follow, that doubting concerning religion implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
such a degree of evidence for it, as, joined with the consideration
of its importance, unquestionably lays men under the obligations
before mentioned, to have a dutiful regard to it in all their
behavior.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, The difficulties in which the evidence of religion is
involved, which some complain of, is no more a just ground of
complaint, than the external circumstances of temptation, which
others are placed in; or than difficulties in the practice of it,
after a full conviction of its truth. Temptations render our state
a more improving state of discipline,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> than it would be otherwise:
as they give occasion for a more attentive exercise of the
virtuous principle, which confirms and strengthens it more, than
an easier or less attentive exercise of it could. Speculative difficulties
are, in this respect, of the very same nature with these
external temptations. For the evidence of religion not appearing
obvious, is to some persons a temptation to reject it, without any
consideration at all; and therefore requires such an attentive
exercise of the virtuous principle, seriously to consider that evidence,
as there would be no occasion for, but for such temptation.
And the supposed doubtfulness of its evidence, after it has been
in some sort considered, affords opportunity to an unfair mind of
explaining away, and deceitfully hiding from itself, that evidence
which it might see; and also for men’s encouraging themselves
in vice, from hopes of impunity, though they do clearly see thus
much at least, that these hopes are uncertain. In like manner
the common temptation to many instances of folly, which end in
temporal infamy and ruin, is the ground for hope of not being
detected, and of escaping with impunity; <i>i.e.</i> the doubtfulness
of the proof beforehand, that such foolish behavior will thus end
in infamy and ruin. On the contrary, supposed doubtfulness in
the evidence of religion calls for a more careful and attentive
exercise of the virtuous principle, in fairly yielding themselves
up to the proper influence of any real evidence, though doubtful;
and in practising conscientiously all virtue, though under some
uncertainty, whether the government in the universe may not
possibly be such, as that vice may escape with impunity. And
in general, temptation, meaning by this word the lesser allurements
to wrong and difficulties in the discharge of our duty, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
well as the greater ones; temptation, I say, as such and of every
kind and degree, as it calls forth some virtuous efforts, additional
to what would otherwise have been wanting, cannot but be an
additional discipline and improvement of virtue, as well as probation
of it in the other senses of that word.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> So that the very
same account is to be given, why the evidence of religion should
be left in such a manner, as to require, in some, an attentive,
solicitous, perhaps painful exercise of their understanding about
it; as why others should be placed in such circumstances, as that
the practice of its common duties, after a full conviction of the
truth of it, should require attention, solicitude, and pains: or,
why appearing doubtfulness should be permitted to afford matter
of temptation to some; as why external difficulties and allurements
should be permitted to afford matter of temptation to others.
The same account also is to be given, why some should be exercised
with temptations of both these kinds; as why others should
be exercised with the latter in such very high degrees, as some
have been, particularly as the primitive Christians were.</p>

<p>Nor does there appear any absurdity in supposing, that the
speculative difficulties, in which the evidence of religion is involved,
may make even the principal part of some persons’ trial.
For as the chief temptations of the generality of the world are
the ordinary motives to injustice, or unrestrained pleasure, or to
live in the neglect of religion, from that frame of mind which
renders many persons almost without feeling as to any thing distant,
or which is not the object of their senses; so there are
other persons without this shallowness of temper, persons of a
deeper sense as to what is invisible and future; who not only see,
but have a general practical feeling, that what is to come will be
present, and that things are not less real for their not being the
objects of sense; and who, from their natural constitution of
body and of temper, and from their external condition, may have
small temptations to behave ill, small difficulty in behaving well,
in the common course of life. Now when these latter persons
have a distinct full conviction of me truth of religion, without
any possible doubts or difficulties, the practice of it is to them
unavoidable, unless they do a constant violence to their own
minds; and religion is scarce any more a discipline to them, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
it is to creatures in a state of perfection. Yet these persons may
possibly stand in need of moral discipline and exercise, in a higher
degree than they would have by such an easy practice of religion.
Or it may be requisite, for reasons unknown to us, that they
should give some further manifestation<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> what is their moral character,
to the creation of God, than such a practice of it would
be. Thus in the great variety of religious situations in which
men are placed, what constitutes, what chiefly and peculiarly
constitutes, the probation, in all senses, of some persons, may be
the difficulties in which the evidence of religion is involved: and
their principal and distinguished trial may be, how they will
behave under and with respect to these difficulties. Circumstances
in men’s situation in their temporal capacity, analogous
in good measure to this respecting religion, are to be observed.
We find some persons are placed in such a situation in the world,
as that their chief difficulty with regard to conduct, is not the
doing what is prudent when it is known; for this, in numberless
cases, is as easy as the contrary: but to some the principal exercise
is, recollection and being upon their guard against deceits,
the deceits suppose of those about them; against false appearances
of reason and prudence. To persons in some situations,
the principal exercise with respect to conduct is, attention in
order to inform themselves what is proper, what is really the
reasonable and prudent part to act.</p>

<p>[<i>Fourthly.</i>] As I have hitherto gone upon supposition, that
men’s dissatisfaction with the evidence of religion is not owing
to their neglects or prejudices; it must be added, on the other
hand, in all common reason, and as what the truth of the case
plainly requires should be added, that such dissatisfaction possibly
may be owing to those, possibly may be men’s own fault.
For,</p>

<p>If there are any persons, who never set themselves heartily
and in earnest to be informed in religion: if there are any, who
secretly wish it may not prove true; and are less attentive to
evidence than to difficulties, and more to objections than to what
is said in answer to them: these persons will scarce be thought
in a likely way of seeing the evidence of religion, though it were
most certainly true, and capable of being ever so fully proved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
If any accustom themselves to consider this subject in the
way of mirth and sport: if they attend to forms and representations,
and inadequate manners of expression, instead of the
real things intended by them: (for signs often can be no more
than inadequately expressive of the things signified:) or if they
substitute human errors in the room of divine truth; why may
not all, or any of these things, hinder some men from seeing that
evidence, which really is seen by others; as a like turn of mind,
with respect to matters of common speculation and practice, does,
we find by experience, hinder them from attaining that knowledge
and right understanding, in matters of common speculation and
practice, which more fair and attentive minds attain to? And
the effect will be the same, whether their neglect of seriously
considering the evidence of religion, and their indirect behavior
with regard to it, proceed from mere carelessness, or from the
grosser vices; or whether it be owing to this, that forms and
figurative manners of expression, as well as errors, administer
occasions of ridicule, when the things intended, and the truth
itself, would not. Men may indulge a ludicrous turn so far as to
lose all sense of conduct and prudence in worldly affairs, and even,
as it seems, to impair their faculty of reason. And in general,
levity, carelessness, passion, and prejudice <em>do</em> hinder us from
being rightly informed, with respect to common things: and they
<em>may</em>, in like manner, and perhaps, in some further providential
manner, with respect to moral and religious subjects: may hinder
evidence from being laid before us, and from being seen when it
is. The Scripture<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> does declare, that every one <em>shall not understand</em>.
And it makes no difference, by what providential conduct
this comes to pass: whether the evidence of Christianity
was, originally and with design, put and left so, as that those who
are desirous of evading moral obligations should not see it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that honest-minded persons should: or, whether it comes to pass
by any other means.</p>

<p>Further: [<i>Fifthly.</i>] The general proof of natural religion and
of Christianity does, I think, lie level to common men: even
those, the greatest part of whose time, from childhood to old age,
is taken up with providing for themselves and their families the
common conveniences, perhaps necessaries, of life: those I mean,
of this rank, who ever think at all of asking after proof, or
attending to it. Common men, were they as much in earnest
about religion, as about their temporal affairs, are capable of
being convinced upon real evidence, that there is a God who
governs the world: and they feel themselves to be of a moral
nature, and accountable creatures. And as Christianity entirely
falls in with this their natural sense of things, so they are capable,
not only of being persuaded, but of being made to see, that
there is evidence of miracles wrought in attestation of it, and
many appearing completions of prophecy.</p>

<p>This proof, though real and conclusive, is liable to objections,
and may be run up into difficulties; which however persons who
are capable not only of talking of, but of really seeing, are capable
also of seeing through: <i>i.e.</i> not of clearing up and answering
them, so as to satisfy their curiosity, for of such knowledge we
are not capable with respect to any one thing in nature; but
capable of seeing that the proof is not lost in these difficulties,
or destroyed by these objections. But then a thorough examination
into religion with regard to these objections, which cannot
be the business of every man, is a matter of pretty large compass,
and, from the nature of it, requires some knowledge, as well as
time and attention; to see, how the evidence comes out, upon
balancing one thing with another, and what, upon the whole, is
the amount of it. If persons who pick up these objections from
others, and take for granted they are of weight, upon the word
of those from whom they received them, or, by often retailing of
them, come to see or fancy they see them to be of weight; will
not prepare themselves for such an examination, with a competent
degree of knowledge; or will not give that time and
attention to the subject, which, from the nature of it, is necessary
for attaining such information: in this case, they must
remain in doubtfulness, ignorance, or error: in the same way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
they must, with regard to common sciences, and matters of common
life, if they neglect the necessary means of being informed
in them.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will still be objected, that if a prince or common
master were to send directions to a servant, he would take
care, that they should always bear the certain marks, who they
came from, and that their sense should be always plain: so as
that there should be no possible doubt if he could help it, concerning
the authority or meaning of them. The proper answer
to all this kind of objections is, that, wherever the fallacy lies, it
is even certain we cannot argue thus with respect to Him who is
the Governor of the world: and that he does not afford us such
information, with respect to our temporal affairs and interests,
experience abundantly shows.</p>

<p>However, there is a full answer to this objection, from the very
nature of religion. The reason why a prince would give his
directions in this plain manner is, that he absolutely desires an
external action done, without concerning himself with the motive
or principle upon which it is done: <i>i.e.</i> he regards only the external
event, or the thing’s being done; and not at all, properly
speaking, the doing of it, or the action. Whereas the whole
of morality and religion consisting merely in action itself, there
is no sort of parallel between the cases. But if the prince be
supposed to regard only the action; <i>i.e.</i> only to desire to exercise,
or in any sense prove, the understanding or loyalty of a servant;
he would not always give his orders in such a plain manner. It
may be proper to add, that the will of God, respecting morality
and religion, may be considered either as absolute, or as only conditional.
If it be absolute, it can only be thus, that we should
act virtuously in such given circumstances; not that we should be
brought to act so, by this changing of our circumstances. And if
God’s will be thus absolute, then it is in our power, in the highest
and strictest sense, to do or to contradict his will; which is a
most weighty consideration. Or his will may be considered only
as conditional, that if we act so and so, we shall be rewarded: if
otherwise, punished: of which conditional will of the Author
of nature, the whole constitution of it affords most certain
instances.</p>

<p>Upon the whole: that we are in a state of religion necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
implies, that we are in a state of probation: and the credibility
of our being at all in such a state being admitted, there seems no
peculiar difficulty in supposing our probation to be, just as it is,
in those respects which are above objected against. There seems
no pretence, from <em>the reason of the thing</em>, to say, that the trial
cannot equitably be any thing, but whether persons will act
suitably to certain information, or such as admits no room for
doubt; so as that there can be no danger of miscarriage, but
either from their not attending to what they certainly know, or
from overbearing passion hurrying them on to act contrary to it.
For, since ignorance and doubt, afford scope for probation in all
senses, as really as intuitive conviction or certainty; and since
the two former are to be put to the same account as difficulties in
practice; men’s moral probation may also be, whether they will
take due care to inform themselves by impartial consideration,
and afterwards whether they will act as the case requires, upon
the evidence which they have, however doubtful. And this, we
find by <em>experience</em>, is frequently our probation,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> in our temporal
capacity. For, the information which we want with regard to
our worldly interests is by no means always given us of course,
without any care of our own. And we are greatly liable to self-deceit
from inward secret prejudices, and also to the deceits of
others. So that to be able to judge what is the prudent part,
often requires much and difficult consideration. Then after we
have judged the very best we can, the evidence upon which we
must act, if we will live and act at all, is perpetually doubtful to
a very high degree. And the constitution and course of the
world in fact is such, as that want of impartial consideration
what we have to do, and venturing upon extravagant courses because
it is doubtful what will be the consequence, are often naturally,
<i>i.e.</i> providentially, altogether as fatal, as misconduct occasioned
by heedless inattention to what we certainly know, or
disregarding it from overbearing passion.</p>

<p>Several of the observations here made may well seem strange,
perhaps unintelligible, to many good men. But if the persons
for whose sake they are made think so, (persons who object as
above, and throw off all regard to religion under pretence of want
of evidence;) I desire them to consider again, whether their thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
so be owing to any thing unintelligible in these observations,
or to their own not having such a sense of religion and serious
solicitude about it, as even their state of scepticism does in all
reason require? It ought to be forced upon the reflection of
these persons, that our nature and condition necessarily require
us, in the daily course of life, to act upon evidence much lower
than what is commonly called probable: to guard, not only against
what we fully believe will, but also against what we think it supposable
may, happen; and to engage in pursuits when the probability
is greatly against success, if it even be credible, that
possibly we may succeed in them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PARTICULAR EVIDENCE FOR CHRISTIANITY.</span></h3>

<p>The presumptions against revelation, and objections against
the general scheme of Christianity, and particular things relating
to it, being removed, there remains to be considered, what positive
evidence we have for the truth of it; chiefly in order to see,
what the analogy of nature suggests with regard to that evidence,
and the objections against it: or to see what is, and is allowed
to be, the plain natural rule of judgment and of action, in our
temporal concerns, in cases where we have the same kind of
evidence, and the same kind of objections against it, that we
have in the case before us.</p>

<p>In the evidence of Christianity there seem to be several things
of great weight, not reducible to the head, either of miracles, or
the completion of prophecy, in the common acceptation of the
words. But these two are its direct and fundamental proofs:
and those other things, however considerable they are, yet ought
never to be urged apart from its direct proofs, but always to be
joined with them. Thus the evidence of Christianity will be a
long series of things, reaching, as it seems, from the beginning
of the world to the present time, of great variety and compass,
taking in both the direct and also the collateral, proofs, and
making up, all of them together, one argument. The conviction
arising from this kind of proof may be compared to what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
call <em>the effect</em>, in architecture or other works of art; a result from
a great number of things, so and so disposed, and taken into one
view. I shall therefore, <i>first</i>, make some observations relating
to miracles, and the appearing completions of prophecy; and
consider what analogy suggests, in answer to the objections
brought against this evidence. And, <i>secondly</i>, I shall endeavor
to give some account of the general argument now mentioned,
consisting both of the direct and collateral evidence, considered
as making up one argument: this being the kind of proof, upon
which we determine most questions of difficulty, concerning
common facts, alleged to have happened, or seeming likely to
happen; especially questions relating to conduct.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, I shall make some observations upon the direct proof of
Christianity from miracles and prophecy, and upon the objections
alleged against it.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>I. Now the following observations relating to the <em>historical
evidence of miracles</em> wrought in attestation of Christianity appear
to be of great weight.</p>

<p>1. The Old Testament affords us the same historical evidence
of the miracles of Moses and of the prophets, as of the common
civil history of Moses and the kings of Israel; or, as of the
affairs of the Jewish nation. And the <cite>Gospels</cite> and <cite>the Acts</cite>
afford us the same historical evidence of the miracles of Christ
and the apostles, as of the common matters related in them.
This indeed could not have been affirmed by any reasonable man,
if the authors of these books, like many other historians, had
appeared to aim at an entertaining manner of writing, and hence
interspersed miracles in their works, at proper distances and upon
proper occasions. These might have animated a dull relation,
amused the reader, and engaged his attention. And the same
account would naturally have been given of them, as of the
speeches and descriptions given by such authors: the same account,
in a manner, as is to be given, why the poets make use of
wonders and prodigies. But the facts, both miraculous and
natural, in Scripture, are related in plain unadorned narratives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and both of them appear, in all respects, to stand upon the same
foot of historical evidence.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Further: some parts of Scripture, containing an account of
miracles fully sufficient to prove the truth of Christianity, are
quoted as genuine, from the age in which they are said to be
written, down to the present: and no other parts of them,
material in the present question, are omitted to be quoted in such
manner, as to afford any sort of proof of their not being genuine.
And, as common history, when called in question in any instance,
may often be greatly confirmed by contemporary or subsequent
events more known and acknowledged; and as the common
Scripture history, like many others, is thus confirmed; so likewise
is the miraculous history of it, not only in particular instances,
but in general. For, the establishment of the Jewish
and Christian religions, which were events contemporary with the
miracles related to be wrought in attestation of both, or subsequent
to them, these events are just what we should have <em>expected</em>,
upon supposition such miracles were really wrought to
attest the truth of those religions. These miracles are a satisfactory
account of those events: of which no other satisfactory
account can be given; nor any account at all, but what is merely
imaginary and invented.</p>

<p>It is to be added, that the most obvious, the most easy and
direct account of this history, how it came to be written, and to
be received in the world as a true history, is that it really is so;
nor can any other account of it be easy and direct. Now, though
an account, not at all obvious, but very far-fetched and indirect,
may be and often is, the true account of a matter, yet it cannot
be admitted on the authority of its being asserted. Mere guess,
supposition, and possibility, when opposed to historical evidence,
prove nothing, but that historical evidence is not demonstrative.</p>

<p>The just consequence from all this, I think is, that the Scripture
history in general is to be admitted as an authentic genuine
history, till something positive be alleged sufficient to invalidate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
it. No man will deny the consequence to be, that it cannot be
rejected, or thrown by as of no authority, till it can be proved to
be of none; even though the evidence now mentioned for its
authority were doubtful. This evidence may be confronted by
historical evidence on the other side, if there be any: or general
incredibility in the things related, or inconsistence in the general
turn of the history, would prove it to be of no authority. But
since, upon the face of the matter, upon a first and general view,
the <em>appearance</em> is, that it is an authentic history, it cannot be
determined to be fictitious, without some proof that it is so.
The following observations in support of these, and coincident
with them, will greatly confirm the historical evidence for the
truth of Christianity.</p>

<p>2. The Epistles of Paul, from the nature of epistolary writing,
and moreover from several of them being written, not to particular
persons but to churches, carry in them evidences of their
being genuine, beyond what can be in a mere historical narrative,
left to the world at large. This evidence,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> joined with that
which they have in common with the rest of the New Testament,
seems not to leave so much as any particular pretence for denying
their genuineness, considered as an ordinary matter of fact,
or of criticism: I say <em>particular</em> pretence, for <em>denying</em> it; because
any single fact, of such a kind and such antiquity, may
have <em>general doubts</em> raised concerning it, from the very nature of
human affairs and human testimony. There is also to be mentioned
a distinct and particular evidence of the genuineness of
the epistle chiefly referred to here, the first to the Corinthians;
from the manner in which it is quoted by Clemens Romanus, in
an epistle of his own to that church.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Now these epistles afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a proof of Christianity, detached from all others, which is, I
think, a thing of weight; and also a proof of a nature and kind
peculiar to itself. For,</p>

<p>In them the author declares, that he received the Gospel in
general, and the institution of the Communion in particular, not
from the rest of the apostles, or jointly together with them, but
alone, from Christ himself; whom he declares likewise, conformably
to the history in the Acts, that he saw after his ascension.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
So that the testimony of Paul is to be considered, as detached
from that of the rest of the apostles.</p>

<p>He declares further, that he was endued with a power of working
miracles, as what was publicly known to those very people,
speaks of frequent and great variety of miraculous gifts as then
subsisting in those very churches, to which he was writing;
which he was reproving for several irregularities, and where he
had personal opposers. He mentions these gifts incidentally, in
the most easy manner, and without effort; by way of reproof to
those who had them, for their indecent use of them; and by
way of depreciating them, in comparison of moral virtues. In
short he speaks to these churches, of these miraculous powers,
in the manner any one would speak to another of a thing, which
was as familiar, and as much known in common to them both, as
any thing in the world.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> And this, as hath been observed by
several persons, is surely a very considerable thing.</p>

<p>3. It is an acknowledged historical fact, that Christianity
offered itself to the world, and demanded to be received, upon
the allegation, (<i>i.e.</i> as unbelievers would speak, upon the pretence,)
of miracles, publicly wrought to attest the truth of it, in
such an age; and that it was actually received by great numbers
in that very age, and upon the professed belief of the reality of
these miracles. And Christianity, including the dispensation of
the Old Testament, seems distinguished by this from all other
religions. I mean, that this does not <em>appear</em> to be the case with
regard to any other; for surely it will not be supposed to lie
upon any person, to prove by positive historical evidence, that it
was not. It does in no sort appear that Mahometanism was first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
received in the world upon the foot of supposed miracles,<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> <i>i.e.</i>
public ones:<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> for, as revelation is itself miraculous, all pretence
to it must necessarily imply some pretence of miracles. And it
is a known fact, that it was immediately, at the very first, propagated
by other means. And as particular institutions, whether
in Paganism or Popery, said to be confirmed by miracles <em>after</em>
those institutions had obtained, are not to the purpose: so, were
there what might be called historical proof, that any of them
were introduced by a supposed divine command, believed to be
attested by miracles; these would not be in any wise parallel.
For single things of this sort are easy to be accounted for, after
parties are formed, and have power in their hands; and the
leaders of them are in veneration with the multitude; and political
interests are blended with religious claims, and religious distinctions.
But <em>before</em> any thing of this kind, for a few persons,
and those of the lowest rank, all at once, to bring over such great
numbers to a new religion, and get it to be received upon the
particular evidence of miracles; this is quite another thing.</p>

<p>I think it will be allowed by any fair adversary, that the fact
now mentioned, taking in all the circumstances, is peculiar to the
Christian religion. However, the fact itself is allowed, that
Christianity obtained, <i>i.e.</i> was professed to be received in the
world, upon the belief of miracles, immediately in the age in
which it is said those miracles were wrought: or that this is
what its first converts would have alleged, as the reason for
their embracing it. It is not to be supposed that such numbers
of men, in the most distant parts of the world, should forsake the
religion of their country, in which they had been educated;
separate themselves from their friends, particularly in their
festival shows and solemnities, to which the common people are
so greatly addicted, and which were of a nature to engage them
much more, than any thing of that sort among us: and embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
a religion, which could not but expose them to many inconveniences,
and indeed must have been a giving up the world in a
great degree, even from the very first, and before the empire engaged
in form against them: it cannot be supposed, that such
numbers should make so great, and to say the least, so inconvenient
a change in their whole institution of life, unless they
were really convinced of the truth of those miracles, upon the
knowledge or belief of which they professed to make it. And
it will, I suppose, readily be acknowledged, that the generality
of the first converts to Christianity must have believed them:
that as by becoming Christians they declared to the world, they
were satisfied of the truth of those miracles; so this declaration
was to be credited. And this their testimony is the same kind
of evidence for those miracles, as if they had put it in writing,
and these writings had come down to us. And it is real evidence,
because it is of facts, which they had capacity and full
opportunity to inform themselves of.</p>

<p>It is also distinct from the direct or express historical evidence,
though it is of the same kind: and would be allowed to be distinct
in all cases. For were a fact expressly related by one or
more ancient historians, and disputed in after ages; that this
fact is acknowledged to have been <em>believed</em> by great numbers of
the age in which the historian says it was done, would be allowed
an additional proof of such fact, quite distinct from the express
testimony of the historian. The credulity of mankind is acknowledged:
and the suspicions of mankind ought to be acknowledged
too; and their backwardness even to believe, and greater still to
practise, what makes against their interest. And it must particularly
be remembered, that education, and prejudice, and
authority, were against Christianity, in the age I am speaking
of. So that the immediate conversion of such numbers is a real
presumption of somewhat more than human in this matter.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
say presumption, for it is not alleged as a proof alone and by
itself. Nor need any one of the things mentioned in this
chapter be considered as a proof by itself: and yet all of them
together may be one of the strongest.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Upon the whole: as there is large historical evidence, both
direct and circumstantial, of miracles wrought in attestation of
Christianity, collected by those who have writ upon the subject;
it lies upon unbelievers to show why this evidence is not to be
credited. This way of speaking is, I think, just; and what persons
who write in defence of religion naturally fall into. Yet, in
a matter of such unspeakable importance, the proper question is,
not whom it lies upon, according to the rules of argument, to
maintain or confute objections: but whether there really are any,
against this evidence, sufficient, in reason, to destroy the credit
of it. However, unbelievers seem to take upon them the part
of showing that there are.</p>

<p>They allege, that numberless enthusiastic people, in different
ages and countries, expose themselves to the same difficulties
which the primitive Christians did; and are ready to give up
their lives for the most idle follies imaginable. It is not very
clear, to what purpose this objection is brought. For surely,
every one, in every case, must distinguish between opinions and
facts. And though testimony is no proof of enthusiastic opinions,
or of any <em>opinion</em> at all; yet it is allowed, in all other cases, to
be a proof of <em>facts</em>. A person’s laying down his life in attestation
of facts or of opinions, is the strongest proof of his believing
them. And if the apostles and their contemporaries did believe
the facts, in attestation of which they exposed themselves
to sufferings and death; this their belief, or rather knowledge,
must be a proof of those facts: for they were such as came
under the observation of their senses. And though it is not of
equal weight, yet it is of weight, that the martyrs of the next
age, notwithstanding they were not eye-witnesses of those facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
as were the apostles and their contemporaries, had, however, full
opportunity to inform themselves whether they were true or not,
and gave equal proof of their believing them to be true.</p>

<p>But enthusiasm, it is said, greatly weakens the evidence of
testimony even for facts, in matters relating to religion: some
seem to think it totally and absolutely destroys the evidence of
testimony upon this subject. The powers of enthusiasm, and of
diseases too, which operate in a like manner, are indeed very
wonderful, in particular instances. But if great numbers of
men, not appearing in any peculiar degree weak, nor under any
peculiar suspicion of negligence, affirm that they saw and heard
such things plainly, with their eyes and their ears, and are
admitted to be in earnest; such testimony is evidence of the
strongest kind we can have, for any matter of fact. Possibly it
may be overcome, strong as it is, by incredibility in the things
thus attested, or by contrary testimony. And in an instance
where one thought it was so overcome, it might be just to consider,
how far such evidence could be accounted for by enthusiasm; for
it seems as if no other imaginable account were to be given of it.
But till such incredibility be shown, or contrary testimony produced,
it cannot surely be expected, that so far-fetched, so indirect
and wonderful an account of such testimony, as that of
enthusiasm must be; an account so strange, that the generality
of mankind can scarce be made to understand what is meant by
it; it cannot, I say, be expected that such an account will be
admitted of such evidence; when there is this direct, easy, and
obvious account of it, that people really saw and heard a thing
not incredible, which they affirm, sincerely and with full assurance,
they did see and hear.</p>

<p>Granting then that enthusiasm is not (strictly speaking) an
absurd, but a possible account of such testimony, it is manifest,
that the very mention of it goes upon the previous supposition,
that the things so attested are incredible: and therefore need not
be considered, till they are shown to be so. Much less need it
be considered, after the contrary has been proved. And I think
it has been proved, to full satisfaction, that there is no incredibility
in a revelation, in general; or in such a one as the Christian,
in particular. However, as religion is supposed peculiarly
liable to enthusiasm, it may just be observed, that prejudices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
almost without number, and without name, such as romance,
affection, humor, a desire to engage attention, or to surprise,
party spirit, custom, little competitions, unaccountable likings
and dislikings; these influence men strongly in common matters.
And as these prejudices are often scarce know a or reflected upon
by the persons themselves who are influenced by them, they are
to be considered as influences of a like kind to enthusiasm. Yet
human testimony, in common matters, is naturally and justly
believed, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>It is intimated further, in a more refined way of observation,
that though it should be proved, that the apostles and first Christians
could not, in some respects, be deceived themselves, and
in other respects, cannot be thought to have intended to impose
upon the world, yet it will not follow that their general testimony
is to be believed, though truly handed down to us: because
they might still in part, <i>i.e.</i> in other respects, be deceived themselves,
and in part also designedly impose upon others; which,
it is added, is a thing very credible, from that mixture of real
enthusiasm, and real knavery, to be met with in the same
characters.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>I must confess, I think the matter of fact contained in this
observation upon mankind is not to be denied; and that something
very much akin to it is often supposed in Scripture as a
very common case, and most severely reproved. But it were to
have been expected, that persons capable of applying this observation
as applied in the objection, might also frequently have
met with the like mixed character, in instances where religion
was quite out of the case. The thing plainly is, that mankind
are naturally endued with reason, or a capacity of distinguishing
between truth and falsehood; and as naturally they are endued
with veracity, or a regard to truth in what they say: but from
many occasions they are liable to be prejudiced and biassed and
deceived themselves, and capable of intending to deceive others,
in every degree: insomuch that, as we are all liable to be deceived
by prejudice, so likewise it seems to be not an uncommon
thing, for persons who, from their regard to truth, would not
invent a lie entirely without any foundation at all, to propagate
it with heightening circumstances, after it is once invented and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
set a-going. And others, though they would not <em>propagate</em> a lie,
yet, which is a lower degree of falsehood, will let it pass without
contradiction. But notwithstanding all this, <em>human testimony</em>
remains still a natural ground of assent; and this assent a
natural principle of action.</p>

<p>It is objected further, that however it has happened, the <em>fact</em>
is, that mankind have, in different ages, been strangely deluded
with pretences to miracles and wonders. But it is by no means
to be admitted, that they have been oftener, or are at all more
liable to be deceived by these than by other pretences.</p>

<p>It is added, that there is a very considerable degree of historical
evidence for miracles, which are, on all hands, acknowledged
to be fabulous. But suppose there were even <em>the like</em>
historical evidence for these, to what there is for those alleged in
proof of Christianity, which yet is in no wise allowed, but suppose
this; the consequence would not be, that the evidence of
the latter is not to be admitted. Nor is there a man in the
world, who in common cases, would conclude thus. For what
would such a conclusion really amount to but this, that evidence,
confuted by contrary evidence, or any way overbalanced, destroys
the credibility of other evidence, neither confuted nor overbalanced?
To argue that because there is, if there were, like
evidence from testimony, for miracles acknowledged false, as for
those in attestation of Christianity, therefore the evidence in the
latter case is not to be credited; this is the same as to argue, that
if two men of equally good reputation had given evidence in
different cases no way connected, and one of them had been
convicted of perjury, this confuted the testimony of the other!</p>

<p>Upon the whole then, the general observation, that human
creatures are so liable to be deceived, from enthusiasm in religion,
and principles equivalent to enthusiasm in common matters,
and in both from negligence; and that they are so capable of
dishonestly endeavoring to deceive others; this does indeed
weaken the evidence of testimony in all cases, but does not
destroy it in any. And these things will appear, to different
men, to weaken the evidence of testimony, in different degrees:
in degrees proportionable to the observations they have made, or
the notions they have any way taken up, concerning the weakness
and negligence and dishonesty of mankind; or concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the powers of enthusiasm, and prejudices equivalent to it. But
it seems to me, that people do not know what they say, who affirm
these things to destroy the evidence from testimony which we
have, of the truth of Christianity. Nothing can destroy the
evidence of testimony in any case, but a proof or probability,
that persons are not competent judges of the facts to which they
give testimony; or that they are actually under some indirect
influence in giving it, in such particular case. Till this be made
out, the <em>natural</em> laws of human actions require, that testimony
be admitted. It can never be sufficient to overthrow direct
historical evidence, indolently to say, that there are so many principles,
from whence men are liable to be deceived themselves,
and disposed to deceive others, especially in matters of religion,
that one knows not what to believe. And it is surprising persons
can help reflecting, that this very manner of speaking supposes
they are not satisfied that there is nothing in the evidence,
of which they speak thus; or that they can avoid observing, if
they do make this reflection, that it is on such a subject, a very
material one.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Over against all these objections is to be set the <em>importance</em> of
Christianity, as what must have engaged the attention of its first
converts, so as to have rendered them less liable to be deceived
from carelessness, than they would in common matters; and likewise
the strong <em>obligations to veracity</em>, which their religion laid
them under: so that the first and most obvious presumption is,
that they could not be deceived themselves nor deceive others.
And this presumption, in this degree, is peculiar to the testimony
we have been considering.</p>

<p>In argument, assertions are nothing in themselves, and have
an air of positiveness which sometimes is not very easy: yet they
are necessary, and necessary to be repeated; in order to connect
a discourse, and distinctly to lay before the view of the reader,
what is proposed to be proved, and what is left as proved. Now
the conclusion from the foregoing observations is, I think, beyond
all doubt, this: that unbelievers must be forced to admit the external
evidence for Christianity, <i>i.e.</i> the proof of miracles wrought
to attest it, to be of real weight and very considerable; though
they cannot allow it to be sufficient, to convince them of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
reality of those miracles. And as they must, in all reason, admit
this; so it seems to me, that upon consideration they would, in
fact, admit it; those of them, I mean, who know any thing at
all of the matter; in like manner as persons, in many cases, own
they see strong evidence from testimony, for the truth of things,
which yet they cannot be convinced are true: cases, suppose,
where there is contrary testimony; or things which they think,
whether with or without reason, to be incredible. But there is
no testimony contrary to that which we have been considering:
and it has been fully proved, that there is no incredibility in
Christianity in general, or in any part of it.</p>

<p>II. As to the evidence for Christianity from prophecy, I shall
only make some few general observations, which are suggested
by the analogy of nature; <i>i.e.</i> by the acknowledged natural rules
of judging in common matters, concerning evidence of a like
kind to this from prophecy.</p>

<p>1. The obscurity or unintelligibleness of one part of a prophecy
does not, in any degree, invalidate the proof of foresight, arising
from the appearing completion of those other parts, which are
understood. For the case is evidently the same, as if those parts
which are not understood were lost, or not written at all, or
written in an unknown tongue. Whether this observation be
commonly attended to or not, it is so evident, that one can scarce
bring oneself to set down an instance in common matters, to
exemplify it. However, suppose a writing, partly in cipher, and
partly in plain words at length; and that in the part one understood,
there appeared mention of several known facts; it would
never come into any man’s thoughts to imagine, that if he understood
the whole, perhaps he might find, that those facts were not
in reality known by the writer. Indeed, both in this example
and in the thing intended to be exemplified by it, our not understanding
the whole (the whole, suppose, of a sentence or a paragraph)
might sometimes occasion a doubt, whether one understood
the literal meaning of such a part: but this comes under another
consideration.</p>

<p>For the same reason, though a man should be incapable, for
want of learning, or opportunities of inquiry, or from not having
turned his studies this way, even so much as to judge whether
particular prophecies have been throughout completely fulfilled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
yet he may see, in general, that they have been fulfilled to such
a degree, as, upon very good ground, to be convinced of foresight
more than human in such prophecies, and of such events being
intended by them. For the same reason also, though, by means
of the deficiencies in civil history, and the different accounts of
historians, the most learned should not be able to make out to
satisfaction, that such parts of the prophetic history have been
minutely and throughout fulfilled; yet a very strong <em>proof of
foresight</em> may arise, from that general completion of them, which
is made out. As much perhaps, as the giver of prophecy intended
should ever be afforded by such parts of prophecy.</p>

<p>2. A long series of prophecy being applicable to such and such
events, is itself a proof that it was intended of them: as the rules
by which we naturally judge and determine, in common cases
parallel to this, will show.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> This observation I make in answer
to the common objection against the application of the prophecies,
that, considering each of them distinctly by itself, it does
not at all appear, that they were intended of those particular
events to which they are applied by Christians; and therefore it
is to be supposed, that if they meant any thing, they were intended
of other events unknown to us, and not of these at all.</p>

<p>Now there are two kinds of writing, which bear a great resemblance
to prophecy, with respect to the matter before us: the
mythological, and the satirical, where the satire is to a certain
degree concealed. And a man might be assured, that he understood
what an author intended by a fable or parable related without
any application or moral, merely from seeing it to be easily
capable of such application, and that such a moral might naturally
be deduced from it. And he might be fully assured, that
such persons and events were intended in a satirical writing,
merely from its being applicable to them. And, agreeable to the
last observation, he might be in a good measure satisfied of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
though he were not enough informed in affairs, or in the story
of such persons to understand half the satire. For, his satisfaction
that he understood the meaning, the intended meaning, of
these writings, would be greater or less in proportion as he saw
the general turn of them to be capable of such application; and
in proportion to the number of particular things capable of it.
And thus, if a long series of prophecy is applicable to the present
state of the church, and to the political situations of the kingdoms
of the world, some thousand years after these prophecies
were delivered; and a long series of prophecy delivered before
the coming of Christ is applicable to him; these things are in
themselves a proof, that the prophetic history was intended of
him, and of those events: in proportion as the general turn of it
is capable of such application, and to the number and variety of
particular prophecies capable of it. And though, in all just way
of consideration, the obvious completion of prophecies is to be
allowed to be thus explanatory of, and to determine, their meaning;
yet it is to be remembered further, that the ancient Jews
applied the prophecies to a Messiah before his coming,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> in much
the same manner as Christians do now: and that the primitive
Christians interpreted the prophecies respecting the state of the
church and of the world in the last ages, in the sense which the
event seems to confirm and verify. From these things it may be
made appear:</p>

<p>3. That the showing even to a high probability, if that could
be, that the prophets thought of some other events, in such and
such predictions, and not those which Christians allege to be
completions of those predictions; or that such and such prophecies
are capable of being applied to other events than those, to
which Christians apply them&mdash;that this would not confute or
destroy the force of the argument from prophecy, even with regard
to those very instances. For, observe how this matter really
is. If one knew such a person to be the sole author of such a
book, and was certainly assured, or satisfied to any degree, that
one knew the whole of what he intended in it; one should be
assured or satisfied to such degree, that one knew the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
meaning of that book: for the meaning of a book is nothing but
the meaning of the author. But if one knew a person to have
<em>compiled</em> a book out of memoirs, which he received from another,
of vastly superior knowledge in the subject of it, especially if it
were a book full of great intricacies and difficulties; it would in
no wise follow, that one knew the whole meaning of the book,
from knowing the whole meaning of the compiler: for the original
author of them, might have, and there would be no presumption,
in many cases, against supposing him to have, some further
meaning than the compiler saw. To say then that the Scriptures,
and the things contained in them, can have no other or
further meaning than those persons had, who first recited or
wrote them, is evidently saying, that those persons were the
original, proper, and sole authors of those books, <i>i.e.</i> that they
are not inspired: which is absurd, while the authority of these
books is under examination; <i>i.e.</i> till you have determined they
are of no divine authority at all. Till this be determined, it
must in all reason be supposed, not indeed that they have, (for
this is taking for granted that they are inspired;) but that they
may have, some further meaning than what the compilers saw or
understood. And, upon this supposition, it is supposable also,
that this further meaning may be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Events corresponding to prophecies, interpreted in a different
meaning from that, in which the prophets are supposed to have
understood them; affords in a manner, the same proof, that this
different sense was originally intended, as it would have afforded,
if the prophets had not understood their predictions in the sense
it is supposed they did: because there is no presumption of <em>their</em>
sense of them being the whole sense of them. And it has been
already shown, that the apparent completions of prophecy must
be allowed to be explanatory of its meaning. So that the question
is, whether a series of prophecy has been fulfilled, in a
natural or proper, <i>i.e.</i> in any real sense of the words of it. For
such completion is equally a proof of foresight more than human,
whether the prophets are, or are not, supposed to have understood
it in a different sense. I say, supposed: for, though I
think it clear, that the prophets did not understand the full
meaning of their predictions, it is another question, how far they
thought they did; and in what sense they understood them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence may be seen, to how little purpose those persons busy
themselves, who endeavor to prove, that the prophetic history is
applicable to events of the age in which it was written, or of ages
before it. To have proved this, before there was any appearance
of a further completion of it, might have answered some purpose;
for it might have prevented the expectation of any such further
completion. Thus could Porphyry have shown, that some principal
parts of the book of Daniel, for instance the seventh verse
of the seventh chapter, which the Christians interpreted of the
latter ages, was applicable to events, which happened before or
about the age of Antiochus Epiphanes; this might have prevented
them from expecting any further completion of it. And, unless
there was then, as I think there must have been, external evidence
concerning that book, more than is come down to us; such
a discovery might have been a stumbling-block in the way of
Christianity itself: considering the authority which our Savior
has given to the book of Daniel, and how much the general
scheme of Christianity presupposes the truth of it. But even
this discovery, had there been any such,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> would be of very little
weight with reasonable men now; if this passage, thus applicable
to events before the age of Porphyry, appears to be applicable
also to events, which succeeded the dissolution of the Roman
empire. I mention this, not at all as intending to insinuate, that
the division of this empire into ten parts, for it plainly was
divided into about that number, were, alone and by itself, of any
moment in verifying the prophetic history: but only as an example
of the thing I am speaking of. Thus upon the whole, the
matter of inquiry evidently must be, as above put, Whether the
prophecies are applicable to Christ, and to the present state of
the world, and of the church; applicable in such a degree, as to
imply foresight: not whether they are <em>capable</em> of any other application.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Though I know no pretence for saying the general turn
of them is capable of any other.</p>

<p>These observations are, I think, just, and the evidence referred
to in them real: though there may be people who will not accept
of such imperfect information from Scripture. Some too have
not integrity and regard enough to truth, to attend to evidence,
which keeps the mind in doubt, perhaps perplexity, and which
is much of a different sort from what they expected. It plainly
requires a degree of modesty and fairness, beyond what every
one has, for a man to say, not to the world but to himself, that
there is a real appearance of great weight in this matter, though
he is not able thoroughly to satisfy himself about it; but that it
shall have its influence upon him, in proportion to its apparent
reality and weight. It is much more easy, and more falls in with
the negligence, presumption, and wilfulness of the generality, to
determine at once, with a decisive air, There is nothing in it.
The prejudices arising from that absolute contempt and scorn,
with which this evidence is treated in the world, I do not mention.
For what can be said to persons, who are weak enough in
their understandings to think this any presumption against it;
or, if they do not, are yet weak enough in their temper to be influenced
by such prejudices, upon such a subject?</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, I shall endeavor to give some account of the general
argument for the truth of Christianity, consisting both of the
direct and circumstantial evidence considered as making up one
argument. To state and examine this argument fully, would be
a work much beyond the compass of this whole treatise; nor is so
much as a proper abridgment of it to be expected here. Yet the
present subject requires to have some brief account of it given.
For it is the kind of evidence, upon which most questions of difficulty,
in common practice, are determined: evidence arising from
various coincidences, which support and confirm each other, and
in this manner prove, with more or less certainty, the point under
consideration. I choose to do it also: First, because it seems to
be of the greatest importance, and not duly attended to by every
one, that the proof of revelation is not some direct and express
things only, but a great variety of circumstantial things also;
and that though each of these direct and circumstantial things is
indeed to be considered separately, yet they are afterwards to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
joined together; for that the proper force of the evidence consists
in the result of those several things, considered in their
respects to each other, and united into one view. In the next
place, because it seems to me, that the matters of fact here set
down, which are acknowledged by unbelievers, must be acknowledged
by them also to contain together a degree of evidence of
great weight, if they could be brought to lay these several things
before themselves distinctly, and then with attention consider
them together; instead of that cursory thought of them, to which
we are familiarized. For being familiarized to the cursory thought
of things as really hinders the weight of them from being seen,
as from having its due influence upon practice.</p>

<p>The thing asserted, and the truth of which is to be inquired
into, is this: That over and above our reason and affections,
which God has given us for the information of our judgment and
the conduct of our lives, he has also, by external revelation, given
us an account of himself and his moral government over the world,
implying a future state of rewards and punishments; <i>i.e.</i> hath
revealed the system of natural religion: (for natural religion may
be externally<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> revealed by God, as the ignorant may be taught it
by their fellow-creatures)&mdash;that God, I say, has given us the evidence
of revelation, as well as the evidence of reason, to ascertain
this moral system; together with an account of a particular dispensation
of Providence, which reason could no way have discovered,
and a particular institution of religion founded on it, for
the recovery of mankind out of their present wretched condition,
and raising them to the perfection and final happiness of their
nature.</p>

<p>This revelation, whether real or supposed, may be considered
as wholly historical. For prophecy is nothing but the history of
events before they come to pass; doctrines also are matters of
fact; and precepts come under the same notion. The general
design of Scripture, which contains in it this revelation, thus
considered as historical, may be said to be, to give us an account
of the world in this one single view, as God’s world: by which
it appears essentially distinguished from all other books, so far as
I have found, except such as are copied from it. It begins with
an account of God’s creation of the world, in order to ascertain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and distinguish from all others, who is the object of our worship,
by what he has done: in order to ascertain, who he is, concerning
whose providence, commands, promises, and threatenings, this
sacred book, all along, treats; [viz.] the Maker and Proprietor
of the world, he whose creatures we are, the God of nature: in
order likewise to distinguish him from the idols of the nations,
which are either imaginary beings, <i>i.e.</i> no beings at all; or else
part of that creation, the historical relation of which is here given.
And John, not improbably with an eye to this Mosaic account
of the creation, begins his Gospel with an account of our Savior’s
pre-existence, and that <cite>all things were made by him; and without
him, was not any thing made that was made</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> agreeably to
the doctrine of Paul, that <cite>God created all things by Jesus Christ</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
This being premised, the Scripture, taken together, seems to profess
to contain a kind of an abridgment of the history of the
world, in the view just now mentioned: that is, a general account
of the condition of religion and its professors, during the continuance
of that apostasy from God, and state of wickedness, which
it everywhere supposes the world to lie in. And this account
of the state of religion carries with it some brief account of the
political state of things, as religion is affected by it. Revelation
indeed considers the common affairs of this world, and what is
going on in it, as a mere scene of distraction; and cannot be supposed
to concern itself with foretelling at what time Rome, or
Babylon, or Greece, or any particular place, should be the most
conspicuous seat of that tyranny and dissoluteness, which all
places equally aspire to be; cannot, I say, be supposed to give
any account of this wild scene for its own sake. But it seems to
contain some very general account of the chief governments of
the world, as the general state of religion has been, is, or shall
be, affected by them, from the first transgression, and during the
whole interval of the world’s continuing in its present state, to a
certain future period, spoken of both in the Old and New Testament,
very distinctly, and in great variety of expression: <cite>The
times of the restitution of all things</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> when <cite>the mystery of God
shall be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
when <cite>the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom, which shall
never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
people</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> as it is represented to be during this apostasy, but <cite>judgment
shall be given to the saints</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and <cite>they shall reign</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> <cite>and the
kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the
Most High</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Upon this general view of the Scripture, I would remark, how
great a length of time the whole relation takes up, near six thousand
years of which are past; and how great a variety of things
it treats of; the natural and moral system or history of the world,
including the time when it was formed, all contained in the very
first book, and evidently written in a rude and unlearned age;
and in subsequent books, the various common and prophetic history,
and the particular dispensation of Christianity. Now all
this together gives the largest scope for criticism; and for the
confutation of what is capable of being confuted, either from
reason, or from common history, or from any inconsistence in its
several parts. And it deserves, I think, to be mentioned, that
whereas some imagine the supposed doubtfulness of the evidence
for revelation implies a positive argument that it is not true; it
appears, on the contrary, to imply a positive argument that it is
true. For, could any common relation of such antiquity, extent,
and variety (for in these things the stress of what I am now observing
lies) be proposed to the examination of the world: that
it could not, in an age of knowledge and liberty, be confuted, or
shown to have nothing in it, to the satisfaction of reasonable
men; would be thought a strong presumptive proof of its truth.
Indeed it must be a <em>proof</em> of it, just in proportion to the probability,
that if it were false, it might be shown to be so: which, I
think, is scarce pretended to be shown, but upon principles and
in ways of arguing, which have been clearly obviated.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Nor
does it at all appear, that any set of men, who believe natural
religion, are of the opinion, that Christianity has been thus
confuted. But to proceed:</p>

<p>Together with the moral system of the world, the Old Testament
contains a chronological account of the beginning of it,
and from thence, an unbroken genealogy of mankind for many
ages before common history begins; and carried on as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
farther as to make up a continued thread of history, of the
length of between three and four thousand years. It contains
an account of God’s making a covenant with a particular nation,
that they should be his people, and he would be their God, in a
peculiar sense; of his often interposing miraculously in their
affairs; giving them the promise, and long after, the possession,
of a particular country; assuring them of the greatest national
prosperity in it, if they would worship him, in opposition to the
idols which the rest of the world worshipped, and obey his commands;
and threatening them with unexampled punishments if
they disobeyed him, and fell into the general idolatry: insomuch
that this one nation should continue to be the observation and
the wonder of all the world. It declares particularly, that <cite>God
would scatter them among all people, from one end of the earth
unto the other</cite>; but that <cite>when they should return unto the Lord
their God, he would have compassion upon them, and gather
them from all the nations, whither he had scattered them</cite>: that
<cite>Israel should be saved in the Lord, with an everlasting salvation;
and not be ashamed or confounded world without end</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> And as
some of these promises are conditional, others are as absolute as
any thing can be expressed: that the time should come, when
<cite>the people should be all righteous, and inherit the land forever</cite>:
that <cite>though God would make a full end of all nations whither
he had scattered them, yet would he not make a full end of
them</cite>: that <cite>he would bring again the captivity of his people
Israel, and plant them upon their land, and they should be no
more pulled up out of their land</cite>: that <cite>the seed of Israel should
not cease from being a nation forever</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> It foretells, that God
would raise them up a particular person, in whom all his promises
should finally be fulfilled; the Messiah, who should be, in a high
and eminent sense, their anointed Prince and Savior. This was
foretold in such a manner, as raised a general expectation of such
a person in the nation, as appears from the New Testament, and
is an acknowledged fact; an expectation of his coming at such a
particular time, before any one appeared claiming to be that person,
and when there was no ground for such an expectation, but
from the prophecies: which expectation, therefore, must in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
reason be presumed to be explanatory of those prophecies, if
there were any doubt about their meaning. It seems moreover
to foretell, that this person should be rejected by the nation to
whom he had been so long promised, though he was so much
desired by them.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> And it expressly foretells, that he should be
the Savior of the Gentiles; and that the completion of the
scheme contained in this book, and then begun, and in its progress,
should be something so great, that in comparison with it,
the restoration of the Jews alone would be but of small account.
<cite>It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up
the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will
also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be for
salvation unto the end of the earth.</cite> And, <cite>In the last days, the
mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of
the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations
shall flow into it&mdash;for out of Zion shall go forth the law,
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge
among the nations&mdash;and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that
day, and the idols he shall utterly abolish.</cite><a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The Scripture further contains an account, that at the time
the Messiah was expected, a person rose up in this nation, claiming
to be that Messiah, to be the person to whom all the prophecies
referred, and in whom they should center: that he spent
some years in a continued course of miraculous works; and
endued his immediate disciples and followers with a power of
doing the same, as a proof of the truth of that religion, which
he commissioned them to publish: that invested with this authority
and power, they made numerous converts in the remotest
countries, and settled and established his religion in the world;
to the end of which the Scripture professes to give a prophetic
account of the state of this religion among mankind.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Let us now suppose a person utterly ignorant of history, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
all this related to him out of the Scripture. Or suppose such
an one, having the Scripture put into his hands, to remark these
things in it, not knowing but that the whole, even its civil history,
as well as the other parts of it, might be, from beginning
to end, an entire invention; and to ask, What truth was in it,
and whether the revelation here related was real, or a fiction?
And, instead of a direct answer, suppose him, all at once, to be
told the following confessed facts; and then to unite them into
one view.</p>

<p>Let him first be told, in how great a degree the profession and
establishment of natural religion, the belief that there is one
God to be worshipped, that virtue is his law, and that mankind
shall be rewarded and punished hereafter, as they obey and disobey
it here; in how very great a degree, I say, the profession
and establishment of this moral system in the world is owing to
the revelation, whether real or supposed, contained in this book:
the establishment of this moral system, even in those countries
which do not acknowledge the proper authority of the Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
Let him be told also, what number of nations do acknowledge its
proper authority. Let him then take in the consideration, of
what importance religion is to mankind. And upon these things
he might, I think, truly observe, that this supposed revelation’s
obtaining and being received in the world, with all the circumstances
and effects of it, considered together as one event, is the
most conspicuous and important event in the history of mankind:
that a book of this nature, and thus promulged and recommended
to our consideration, demands, as if by a voice from heaven, to
have its claims most seriously examined; and that, before such
examination, to treat it with any kind of scoffing and ridicule, is
an offence against natural piety. It is to be remembered, that
how much soever the establishment of natural religion in the
world is owing to the Scripture revelation, this does not destroy
the proof of religion from reason, any more than the proof of
Euclid’s Elements is destroyed, by a man’s knowing or thinking,
that he should never have seen the truth of the several propositions
contained in it, nor had those propositions come into his
thoughts, but for that mathematician.</p>

<p>Let such a person as we are speaking of be, in the next place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
informed of the acknowledged antiquity of the first parts of this
book; and that its chronology, its account of the time when the
earth, and the several parts of it, were first peopled with human
creatures, is no way contradicted, but is really confirmed, by the
natural and civil history of the world, collected from common
historians, from the state of the earth, and from the late invention
of arts and sciences.</p>

<p>And as the Scripture contains an unbroken thread of common
and civil history, from the creation to the captivity, for between
three and four thousand years; let the person we are speaking
of be told, in the next place, that this general history, as it is
not contradicted, but confirmed by profane history<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> as much as
there would be reason to expect, upon supposition of its truth; so
there is nothing in the whole history <em>itself</em>, to give any reasonable
ground of suspicion of its not being, in the general, a faithful
and literally true genealogy of men, and series of things. I
speak here only of the common Scripture history, or of the
course of ordinary events related in it, as distinguished from
miracles, and from the prophetic history. In all the Scripture
narrations of this kind, following events arise out of foregoing
ones, as in all other histories. There appears nothing related as
done in any age, not conformable to the manners of that age:
nothing in the account of a succeeding age, which one would
say could not be true, or was improbable, from the account of
things in the preceding one. There is nothing in the characters,
which would raise a thought of their being feigned; but all the
internal marks imaginable of their being real. It is to be added
also, that mere genealogies, bare narratives of the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
years, which persons called by such and such names lived, do not
carry the face of fiction; perhaps do carry some presumption of
veracity: and all unadorned narratives, which have nothing to
surprise, may be thought to carry somewhat of the like presumption
too. And the domestic and the political history is plainly
credible. There may be incidents in Scripture, which, taken
alone in the naked way they are told, may appear strange; especially
to persons of other manners, temper, education: but there
are also incidents of undoubted truth, in many or most persons’
lives, which, in the same circumstances, would appear to the full
as strange.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> There may be mistakes of transcribers, there may
be other real or seeming mistakes, not easy to be particularly accounted
for: but there are certainly no more things of this kind
in the Scripture, than what were to have been expected in books
of such antiquity; and nothing, in any wise, sufficient to discredit
the general narrative.</p>

<p>Now, that a history, claiming to commence from the creation,
and extending in one continued series, through so great a length
of time, and variety of events, should have such appearances of
reality and truth in its whole contexture, is surely a very remarkable
circumstance in its favor. And as all this is applicable to
the common history of the New Testament, so there is a further
credibility, and a very high one, given to it by profane authors:
many of these writing of the same times, and confirming the truth
of customs and events, which are incidentally as well as more
purposely mentioned in it. And this credibility of the common
Scripture-history, gives some credibility to its miraculous history:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
especially as this is interwoven with the common, so as that they
imply each other, and both together make up one relation.</p>

<p>Let it then be more particularly observed to this person, that
it is an acknowledged matter of fact, which is indeed implied in
the foregoing observation, that there was such a nation as the
Jews, of the greatest antiquity, whose government and general
polity was founded on the law, here related to be given them by
Moses as from heaven: that natural religion, with rites additional
yet no way contrary to it, was their established religion, which
cannot be said of the Gentile world: and that their very being
as a nation, depended upon their acknowledgment of one God,
the God of the universe. For, suppose in their captivity in
Babylon, they had gone over to the religion of their conquerors,
there would have remained no bond of union, to keep them a
distinct people. And while they were under their own kings, in
their own country, a total apostasy from God would have been
the dissolution of their whole government. They in such a sense
nationally acknowledged and worshipped the Maker of heaven
and earth, when the rest of the world were sunk in idolatry, as
rendered them, in fact, the peculiar people of God. This remarkable
establishment and preservation of natural religion
among them, seems to add peculiar credibility to the historical
evidence for the miracles of Moses and the prophets. Because
these miracles are a full satisfactory account of this event, which
plainly needs to be accounted for, and cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p>Let this person, supposed wholly ignorant of history, be acquainted
further, that one claiming to be the Messiah, of Jewish
extraction, rose up at the time when this nation, from the prophecies
above mentioned, expected the Messiah: that he was
rejected, as it seemed to have been foretold he should, by the
body of the people, under the direction of their rulers: that in
the course of a very few years, he was believed on and acknowledged
as the promised Messiah, by great numbers among the
Gentiles, agreeably to the prophecies of Scripture, yet not upon
the evidence of prophecy, but of miracles,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> of which miracles we
have also strong historical evidence; (by which I mean here no
more than must be acknowledged by unbelievers; for let pious
frauds and follies be admitted to weaken, it is absurd to say they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
destroy our evidence of miracles wrought in proof of Christianity:)<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
that this religion approving itself to the reason of mankind, and
carrying its own evidence with it, so far as reason is a judge of
its system, and being no way contrary to reason in those parts of
it which require to be believed upon the mere authority of its
Author; that this religion, I say, gradually spread and supported
itself for some hundred years, not only without any assistance
from temporal power, but under constant discouragements, and
often the bitterest persecutions from it; and then became the
religion of the world: that in the mean time the Jewish nation
and government were destroyed in a very remarkable manner,
and the people carried away captive and dispersed through the
most distant countries; in which state of dispersion they have
remained fifteen hundred years: and that they remain a numerous
people, united among themselves, and distinguished from the rest
of the world, as they were in the days of Moses, by the profession
of his law; and everywhere looked upon in a manner, which
one scarce knows how distinctly to express, but in the words
of the prophetic account of it, given so many ages before it
came to pass: <cite>Thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb,
and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead
thee</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The appearance of a standing miracle, in the Jews remaining
a distinct people in their dispersion, and the confirmation which
this event appears to give to the truth of revelation, may be
thought to be answered, by their religion’s forbidding them intermarriages
with those of other nations, and prescribing them many
peculiarities in their food, by which they are debarred from incorporating
with the people in whose countries they live. This
is not, I think, a satisfactory account of that which it pretends to
account for. But what does it pretend to account for? The
correspondence between this event and the prophecies; or the
coincidence of both, with a long dispensation of Providence, of a
peculiar nature, towards that people? No. It is only the event
itself, which is offered to be thus accounted for: which single
event, taken alone, abstracted from all such correspondence and
coincidence, perhaps would not have appeared miraculous: but
that correspondence and coincidence may be so, though the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
itself be supposed not. Thus the concurrence of our Saviour’s
being born at Bethlehem, with a long foregoing series of prophecy
and other coincidences, is doubtless miraculous; the series of
prophecy, and other coincidences, and the event, being admitted:
though the event itself appears to have been brought about in a
natural way; of which, however, no one can be certain.</p>

<p>As several of these events seem, in some degree expressly, to
have verified the prophetic history already, so likewise they may
be considered further, as having a peculiar aspect towards the
full completion of it; as affording some presumption that the
whole of it shall, one time or other, be fulfilled. Thus, that the
Jews have been so wonderfully preserved in their long and wide
dispersion; which is indeed the direct fulfilling of some prophecies,
but is now mentioned only as looking forward to somewhat
yet to come: that natural religion came forth from Judea, and
spread, in the degree it has done over the world, before lost in
idolatry; which, together with some other things, have distinguished
that very place, in like manner as the people of it are
distinguished: that this great change of religion over the earth
was brought about under the profession and acknowledgment,
that Jesus was the promised Messiah: things of this kind naturally
turn the thoughts of serious men towards the full completion
of the prophetic history, concerning the final restoration of that
people; concerning the establishment of the everlasting kingdom
among them, the kingdom of the Messiah; and the future state
of the world, under this sacred government. Such circumstances
and events, compared with these prophecies, though no completions
of them, yet would not, I think, be spoken of as nothing in
the argument, by a person upon his first being informed of them.
They fall in with the prophetic history of things still future, give
it some additional credibility, and have the appearance of being
somewhat in order to the full completion of it.</p>

<p>Indeed it requires a good degree of knowledge, and great
calmness and consideration, to be able to judge thoroughly of
the evidence for the truth of Christianity, from that part of the
prophetic history which relates to the situation of the kingdoms
of the world, and to the state of the church, from the establishment
of Christianity to the present time. But it appears from a
general view of it, to be very material. And those persons who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
have thoroughly examined it, and some of them were men of the
coolest tempers, greatest capacities, and least liable to imputations
of prejudice, insist upon it as determinately conclusive.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>] Suppose now a person quite ignorant of history,
first to recollect the passages above mentioned out of Scripture,
without knowing but that the whole was a late fiction, then
to be informed of the correspondent facts now mentioned, and to
unite them all into one view: that the profession and establishment
of natural religion in the world is greatly owing, in different
ways, to this book, and the supposed revelation which it
contains; that it is acknowledged to be of the earliest antiquity;
that its chronology and common history are entirely credible;
that this ancient nation, the Jews, of whom it chiefly treats,
appear to have been, in fact, the people of God, in a distinguished
sense; that, as there was a national expectation among
them, raised from the prophecies, of a Messiah to appear at such
a time, so one at this time appeared claiming to be that Messiah;
that he was rejected by this nation, but received by the Gentiles,
not upon the evidence of prophecy, but of miracles; that the
religion he taught supported itself under the greatest difficulties,
gained ground, and at length became the religion of the world;
that in the mean time the Jewish polity was utterly destroyed,
and the nation dispersed over the face of the earth; that notwithstanding
this, they have remained a distinct numerous people
for so many centuries, even to this day; which not only appears
to be the express completion of several prophecies concerning
them, but also renders it, as one may speak, a visible and easy
possibility that the promises made to them as a nation, may yet
be fulfilled.</p>

<p>To these acknowledged truths, let the person we have been
supposing add, as I think he ought, whether every one will allow
it or no, the obvious appearances which there are, of the state
of the world, in other respects besides what relates to the Jews,
and of the Christian church, having so long answered, and still
answering to the prophetic history. Suppose, I say, these facts
set over against the things before mentioned out of the Scripture,
and seriously compared with them; the joint view of both
together must, I think, appear of very great weight to a considerate
reasonable person: of much greater indeed, upon having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
them first laid before him, than is easy for us, who are so familiarized
to them, to conceive, without some particular attention for
that purpose.</p>

<p>All these things, and the several particulars contained under
them, require to be distinctly and most thoroughly examined
into; that the weight of each may be judged of, upon such examination,
and such conclusion drawn, as results from their <em>united
force</em>. But this has not been attempted here. I have gone no
further than to show, that the general imperfect view of them
now given, the confessed historical evidence for miracles, and the
many obvious appearing completions of prophecy, together with
the collateral things<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> here mentioned, and there are several
others of the like sort; that all this together, which, being fact,
must be acknowledged by unbelievers, amounts to real evidence of
somewhat more than human in this matter: evidence much more
important, than careless men, who have been accustomed only to
transient and partial views of it, can imagine; and indeed abundantly
sufficient to act upon. And these things, I apprehend,
must be acknowledged by unbelievers. For though they may
say, that the historical evidence of miracles wrought in attestation
of Christianity, is not sufficient to convince them, that such
miracles were really wrought: they cannot deny, that there is
such historical evidence, it being a known matter of fact that
there is. They may say, the conformity between the prophecies
and events is by accident: but there are many instances in which
such conformity itself cannot be denied. They may say, with
regard to such kind of collateral things as those above mentioned,
that any odd accidental events, without meaning, will have a
meaning found in them by fanciful people: and that such as are
fanciful in any one certain way, will make out a thousand coincidences,
which seem to favor their peculiar follies. Men, I say,
may talk thus: but no one who is serious, can possibly think
these things to be nothing, if he considers the importance of
collateral things, and even of lesser circumstances, in the evidence
of probability, as distinguished in nature, from the evidence
of demonstration. In many cases indeed it seems to require the
truest judgment, to determine with exactness the weight of circumstantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
evidence: but it is very often altogether as convincing,
as that which is the most express and direct.</p>

<p>This general view of the evidence for Christianity, considered
as making one argument, may also serve to recommend to serious
persons, to set down every thing which they think may be of
any real weight at all in proof of it, and particularly the many
seeming completions of prophecy: and they will find, that,
judging by the natural rules, by which we judge of probable
evidence in common matters, they amount to a much higher
degree of proof, upon such a <em>joint review</em>, than could be supposed
upon considering them separately, at different times; how
strong soever the proof might before appear to them, upon such
separate views of it. For probable proofs, by being added, not
only <em>increase</em> the evidence, but <em>multiply</em> it.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Nor should I dissuade
any one from setting down, what he thought made for the
contrary side. But then it is to be remembered, not in order to
influence his judgment, but his practice, that a mistake on one
side may be, in its consequences, much more dangerous, than a
mistake on the other. And what course is most safe, and what
most dangerous, will be thought a very material consideration,
when we deliberate, not concerning events, but concerning conduct
in our temporal affairs. To be influenced by this consideration
in our judgment, to believe or disbelieve upon it, is indeed
as much prejudice, as any thing whatever. And, like other prejudices,
it operates contrary ways, in different men; for some are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>inclined to believe what they hope, and others what they fear.
And it is manifest unreasonableness to apply to men’s passions
in order to gain their assent. But in deliberations concerning
conduct, there is nothing which reason more requires to be taken
into the account, than the importance of it. For, suppose it
doubtful, what would be the consequence of acting in this, or in
the contrary manner: still, that taking one side could be attended
with little or no bad consequence, and taking the other might be
attended with the greatest, must appear, to unprejudiced reason,
of the highest moment towards determining how we are to act.
The truth of our religion, like the truth of common matters, is
to be judged of by all the evidence taken together. And unless
the whole series of things which may be alleged in this argument,
and every particular thing in it, can reasonably be supposed
to have been by accident (for here the stress of the
argument for Christianity lies); then is the truth of it proved:
in like manner, as if in any common case, numerous events
acknowledged, were to be alleged in proof of any other event
disputed; the truth of the disputed event would be proved, not
only if any one of the acknowledged ones did of itself clearly
imply it, but, though no one of them singly did so, if the whole
of the acknowledged events taken together could not in reason
be supposed to have happened, unless the disputed one were
true.</p>

<p>It is obvious, how much advantage the nature of this evidence
gives to those persons who attack Christianity, especially in conversation.
For it is easy to show, in a short and lively manner,
that such and such things are liable to objection, that this and
another thing is of little weight in itself; but impossible to
show, in like manner, the united force of the whole argument
in one view.</p>

<p>Lastly, as it has been made appear, that there is no presumption
against a revelation as miraculous; that the general scheme
of Christianity, and the principal parts of it, are conformable to
the experienced constitution of things, and the whole perfectly
credible: so the account now given of the positive evidence for
it, shows, that this evidence is such, as, from the nature of it,
cannot be destroyed, though it should be lessened.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">OBJECTIONS AGAINST ARGUING FROM THE ANALOGY OF
NATURE, TO RELIGION.</span></h3>

<p>If every one would consider, with such attention as they are
bound, even in point of morality, to consider, what they judge
and give characters of; the occasion of this chapter would be, in
some good measure at least, superseded. But since this is not to
be expected; for some we find do not concern themselves to
understand even what they write against: since this treatise, in
common with most others, lies open to objections, which may
appear very material to thoughtful men at first sight; and, besides
that, seems peculiarly liable to the objections of such as can
judge without thinking, and of such as can censure without
judging; it may not be amiss to set down the chief of these
objections which occur to me, and consider them to their hands.
They are such as these:</p>

<p>“That it is a poor thing to solve difficulties in revelation, by
saying, that there are the same in natural religion; when what
is wanting is to clear both of them of these their common, as
well as other their respective, difficulties; that it is a strange
way indeed of convincing men of the obligations of religion, to
show them, that they have as little reason for their worldly pursuits:
and a strange way of vindicating the justice and goodness
of the Author of nature, and of removing the objections against
both, to which the system of religion lies open, to show, that the
like objections lie against natural providence; a way of answering
objections against religion, without so much as pretending to
make out, that the system of it, or the particular things in it
objected against, are reasonable&mdash;especially, perhaps some may
be inattentive enough to add, must this be thought strange, when
it is confessed that analogy is no answer to such objections: that
when this sort of reasoning is carried to the utmost length it can
be imagined capable of, it will yet leave the mind in a very unsatisfied
state; and that it must be unaccountable ignorance of
mankind, to imagine they will be prevailed with to forego their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
present interests and pleasures, from regard to religion, upon
doubtful evidence.”</p>

<p>Now, as plausible as this way of talking may appear, that appearance
will be found in a great measure owing to half views,
which show but part of an object, yet show that indistinctly, and
to undeterminate language. By these means weak men are often
deceived by others, and ludicrous men, by themselves. And even
those, who are serious and considerate, cannot always readily disentangle,
and at once clearly see through the perplexities, in
which subjects themselves are involved; and which are heightened
by the deficiencies and the abuse of words. To this latter
sort of persons, the following reply to each part of this objection
severally, may be of some assistance; as it may also tend a little
to stop and silence others.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, The thing wanted, <i>i.e.</i> what men require, is to have <em>all</em>
difficulties cleared. And this is, or at least for any thing we
know to the contrary, it may be, the same as requiring to comprehend
the divine nature, and the whole plan of Providence
from everlasting to everlasting! But it hath always been allowed
to argue from what is acknowledged, to what is disputed. And
it is in no other sense a poor thing, to argue from natural religion
to revealed, in the manner found fault with, than it is to
argue in numberless other ways of probable deduction and inference,
in matters of conduct, which we are continually reduced to
the necessity of doing. Indeed the epithet <em>poor</em> may be applied,
I fear as properly, to great part or the whole of human life, as it
is to the things mentioned in the objection. Is it not a poor
thing, for a physician to have so little knowledge in the cure of
diseases, as even the most eminent have? To act upon conjecture
and guess, where the life of man is concerned? Undoubtedly
it is: but not in comparison of having no skill at all
in that useful art, and being obliged to act wholly in the dark.</p>

<p>Further: since it is as unreasonable, as it is common, to urge
objections against revelation, which are of equal weight against
natural religion; and those who do this, if they are not confused
themselves, deal unfairly with others, in making it seem that
they are arguing only against revelation, or particular doctrines
of it, when in reality they are arguing against moral providence;
it is a thing of consequence to show, that such objections are as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
much levelled against natural religion, as against revealed. Objections,
which are equally applicable to both, are properly speaking
answered, by its being shown that they are so, provided the
former be admitted to be true. And without taking in the consideration
how distinctly this is admitted, it is plainly very material
to observe, that as the things objected against in natural
religion are of the same kind with what is certain matter of experience
in the course of providence, and in the information which
God affords us concerning our temporal interest under his government;
so the objections against the system of Christianity, and
the evidence of it, are of the very same kind with those which
are made against the system and evidence of natural religion.
However, the reader upon review may see, that most of the
analogies insisted upon, even in the latter part of this treatise, do
not necessarily require to have more taken for granted than is in
the former; [viz.] that there is an Author of nature, or natural
Governor of the world: and Christianity is vindicated, not from
its analogy to natural religion, but chiefly from its analogy to the
experienced constitution of nature.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Religion is a practical thing, and consists in such a
determinate course of life, as what, there is reason to think, is
commanded by the Author of nature, and will, upon the whole,
be our happiness under his government. If men can be convinced,
that they have the like reason to believe this, as to believe
that taking care of their temporal affairs will be to their
advantage; such conviction cannot but be an argument to them
for the practice of religion. And if there be really any reason
for believing one of these, and endeavoring to preserve life, and
secure ourselves the necessaries and conveniences of it; then
there is reason also for believing the other, and endeavoring to
secure the interest it proposes to us. And if the interest, which
religion proposes to us, be infinitely greater than our whole temporal
interest; then there must be proportionably greater reason
for endeavoring to secure one, than the other; since, by the supposition,
the probability of our securing one is equal to the probability
of our securing the other. This seems plainly unanswerable,
and has a tendency to influence fair minds, who consider what
our condition really is, or upon what evidence we are naturally
appointed to act; and who are disposed to acquiesce in the terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
upon which we live, and attend to and follow that practical instruction,
whatever it be, which is afforded us.</p>

<p>But the chief and proper force of the argument referred to in
the objection, lies in another place. The proof of religion, it is
said, is involved in such inextricable difficulties, as to render it
doubtful; and that it cannot be supposed that if it were true, it
would be left upon doubtful evidence. Here then, over and
above the force of each particular difficulty or objection, these
difficulties and objections taken together are turned into a positive
argument against the truth of religion; which argument
would stand thus. If religion were true, it would not be left
doubtful, and open to objections to the degree in which it is:
therefore that it is thus left, not only renders the evidence of it
weak, and lessens its force, in proportion to the weight of such
objections, but also shows it to be false, or is a general presumption
of its being so. Now the observation, that from the natural
constitution and course of things, we must in our temporal concerns,
almost continually, and even in matters of great consequence,
act upon evidence of a like kind and degree to the evidence
of religion, is an answer to this argument. Because it shows,
that it is according to the conduct and character of the Author
of nature to appoint we should act upon evidence like to that,
which this argument presumes he cannot be supposed to appoint
we should act upon: it is an instance, a general one, made up of
numerous particular ones, of somewhat in his dealing with us,
similar to what is said to be incredible. As the force of this
answer lies merely in the parallel, which there is between the
evidence for religion and for our temporal conduct; the answer
is equally just and conclusive, whether the parallel be made out,
by showing the evidence of the former to be higher, or the evidence
of the latter to be lower.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, The design of this treatise is not to vindicate the
character of God, but to show the obligations of men: it is not to
justify his providence, but to show what belongs to us to do.
These are two subjects, and ought not to be confounded. Though
they may at length run up into each other, yet observations may
immediately tend to make out the latter, which do not appear, by
any immediate connection, to the purpose of the former; which
is less our concern, than many seem to think. For, first,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary we should justify the dispensations of Providence
against objections, any farther than to show, that the things
objected against may, for aught we know, be consistent with justice
and goodness. Suppose then, that there are things in the
system of this world, and plan of Providence relating to it, which
taken alone would be unjust: yet it has been shown unanswerably,
that if we could take in the reference, which these things
may have to other things, present past and to come; to the
whole scheme, which the things objected against are parts of;
these very things might, for aught we know, be found to be, not
only consistent with justice, but instances of it. Indeed it has
been shown, by the analogy of what we see, not only possible that
this may be the case, but credible that it is. And thus objections,
drawn from such things, are answered, and Providence is
vindicated, as far as religion makes its vindication necessary.</p>

<p>Hence it appears, Secondly, that objections against the Divine
justice and goodness are not endeavored to be <em>removed</em>, by showing
that the like objections, allowed to be really conclusive, lie
against natural providence: but those objections being supposed
and shown not to be <em>conclusive</em>, the things objected against, considered
as matters of fact, are farther shown to be credible, from
their conformity to the constitution of nature; for instance, that
God will reward and punish men for their actions hereafter, from
the observation, that he does reward and punish them for their
actions here. And this, I apprehend, is of weight.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it would be of weight, even though those objections
were not answered. For, there being the proof of religion above
set down; and religion implying several facts; for instance again,
the fact last mentioned, that God will reward and punish men for
their actions hereafter; the observation, that his present method
of government is by rewards and punishments, shows that future
fact not to be incredible: whatever objections men may think
they have against it, as unjust or unmerciful, according to their
notions of justice and mercy; or as improbable from their belief
of necessity. I say, <em>as improbable</em>: for it is evident no objection
against it, <em>as unjust</em>, can be urged from necessity; since this
notion as much destroys injustice, as it does justice.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Though objections against the reasonableness of the
system of religion cannot indeed be answered without entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
into consideration of its reasonableness; yet objections against
the credibility or truth of it may. Because the system of it is
reducible into what is properly matter of fact: and the truth, the
probable truth of facts, may be shown without consideration of
their reasonableness. Nor is it necessary, though, in some cases
and respects, it is highly useful and proper, yet it is not necessary,
to give a proof of the reasonableness of every precept enjoined
us, and of every particular dispensation of Providence,
which comes into the system of religion. Indeed the more
thoroughly a person of a right disposition is convinced of the
perfection of the Divine nature and conduct, the farther he
will advance towards that perfection of religion, which John<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
speaks of.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> But the general obligations of religion are fully
made out, by proving the reasonableness of the practice of it.
And that the practice of religion <em>is</em> reasonable, may be shown,
though no more could be proved, than that the system of it <em>may
be</em> so, for aught we know to the contrary: and even without
entering into the distinct consideration of this.</p>

<p>Fifthly, It is easy to see, that though the analogy of nature is
not an immediate answer to objections against the wisdom, the
justice, or goodness, of any doctrine or precept of religion; yet
it may be, as it is, an immediate and direct answer to what is
really intended by such objections; which is, to show that the
things objected against are incredible.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, It is most readily acknowledged, that the foregoing
treatise is by no means satisfactory; very far indeed from it: but
so would any natural institution of life appear, if reduced into a
system, together with its evidence. Leaving religion out of the
case, men are divided in their opinions, whether our pleasures
overbalance our pains: and whether it be, or be not, eligible to
live in this world.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> And were all such controversies settled,
which perhaps, in speculation, would be found involved in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
difficulties; and were it determined upon the evidence of reason,
as nature has determined it to our hands, that life is to be preserved:
still, the rules which God has been pleased to afford us,
for escaping the miseries of it, and obtaining its satisfactions, the
rules, for instance, of preserving health, and recovering it when
lost, are not only fallible and precarious, but very far from being
exact. Nor are we informed by nature, as to future contingencies
and accidents, so as to render it at all certain, what is the
best method of managing our affairs. What will be the success
of our temporal pursuits, in the common sense of the word success,
is highly doubtful. And what will be the success of them
in the proper sense of the word; <i>i.e.</i> what happiness or enjoyment
we shall obtain by them, is doubtful in a much higher
degree. Indeed the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence, with
which we are obliged to take up, in the daily course of life, is
scarce to be expressed. Yet men do not throw away life, or disregard
the interests of it, upon account of this doubtfulness.
The evidence of religion then being admitted real, those who
object against it, as not satisfactory, <i>i.e.</i> as not being what they
wish it, plainly forget the very condition of our being: for
satisfaction, in this sense, does not belong to such a creature
as man.</p>

<p>And, what is more material, they forget also the very nature
of religion. For, religion presupposes, in all those who will
embrace it, a certain degree of integrity and honesty; which it
was intended to try whether men have or not, and to exercise in
such as have it, in order to its improvement. Religion presupposes
this as much, and in the same sense, as speaking to a man
presupposes he understands the language in which you speak; or
as warning a man of any danger presupposes that he hath such
a regard to himself, as that he will endeavor to avoid it. Therefore
the question is not at all, Whether the evidence of religion
be satisfactory; but Whether it be, in reason, sufficient to prove
and discipline that virtue, which it presupposes. Now the evidence
of it is fully sufficient for all those purposes of <em>probation</em>;
how far soever it is from being satisfactory, as to the purposes of
<em>curiosity</em>, or any other: and indeed it answers the purposes of
the former in several respects, which it would not do, if it were
as overpowering as is required. Besides, whether the motives or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the evidence for any course of action be satisfactory, meaning
here, by that word, what satisfies a man that such a course of
action will in event be for his good; this need never be, and I
think, strictly speaking, never is, the practical question in common
matters. The practical question in all cases is, Whether
the evidence for a course of action be such as, taking in all circumstances,
makes the faculty within us, which is the guide and
judge of conduct,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> determine that course of action to be prudent.
Indeed, satisfaction that it will be for our interest or
happiness, abundantly determines an action to be prudent: but
evidence almost infinitely lower than this, determines actions to
be so too; even in the conduct of every day.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, As to the objection concerning the influence which
this argument, or any part of it, may, or may not be expected to
have upon men; I observe, as above, that religion being intended
for a trial<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and exercise of the morality of every person’s character,
who is a subject of it; and there being, as I have shown,
such evidence for it, as is sufficient, in reason, to influence men
to embrace it: to object, that it is not to be imagined mankind
will be influenced by such evidence, is nothing to the purpose of
the foregoing treatise. For the purpose of it is not to inquire,
what sort of creatures mankind are; but what the light and
knowledge, which is afforded them, requires they should be: to
show how, in reason, they ought to behave; not how, in fact,
they will behave. This depends upon themselves, and is their
own concern; the personal concern of each man in particular.
How little regard the generality have to it, experience indeed
does too fully show. But religion, considered as a probation,
has had its end upon all persons, to whom it has been proposed
with evidence sufficient in reason to influence their practice: for
by this means they have been put into a state of probation; let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
them behave as they will in it. Thus, not only revelation, but
reason also, teaches us, that by the evidence of religion being
laid before men, the designs of Providence are carrying on, not
only with regard to those who will be influenced by it, but likewise
with regard to those who will not. Lastly, the objection here
referred to, allows the thing insisted upon in this treatise to be
of <em>some</em> weight; and if so, it may be hoped it will have some
influence. And if there be a probability that it will have any at
all, there is the same reason in kind, though not in degree, to lay
it before men, as there would be, if it were likely to have a greater
influence.</p>

<p>Further, I desire it may be considered, with respect to the
whole of the foregoing objections, that in this treatise I have
argued upon the principles of others,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> not my own: and have
omitted what I think true, and of the utmost importance, because
by others thought unintelligible, or not true. Thus I have argued
upon the principles of the fatalists, which I do not believe: and
have omitted a thing of the utmost importance which I do believe,&mdash;[viz.]
the moral fitness and unfitness of actions, prior
to all will whatever; which as certainly determine the divine
<em>conduct</em>, as speculative truth and falsehood necessarily determine
the divine <em>judgment</em>. Indeed the principle of liberty, and that
of moral fitness, so force themselves upon the mind, that moralists,
ancient as well as modern, have formed their language upon
it. And probably it may appear in mine, though I have endeavored
to avoid it; and, in order to avoid it, have sometimes been
obliged to express myself in a manner, which will appear strange
to such as do not observe the reason for it. But the general
argument here pursued, does not at all suppose, or proceed upon
these principles.</p>

<p>Now, these two abstract principles of liberty and moral fitness
being omitted, religion can be considered in no other view, than
merely as a question of fact: and in this view it is here considered.
It is obvious, that Christianity, and the proof of it,
are both historical. Even natural religion is, properly, a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of fact. For, that there is a righteous Governor of the world, is
so: and this proposition contains the general system of natural
religion. But then, several abstract truths, and in particular
those two principles, are usually taken into consideration in the
proof of it: whereas it is here treated of only as a matter of
fact. To explain this; That the three angles of a triangle are
equal to two right ones, is an abstract truth; but that they appear
so to our mind, is only a matter of fact. This last must
have been admitted, if any thing was, by those ancient sceptics,
who would not admit the former: but pretended to doubt,
whether there were any such thing as truth, or whether we
could certainly depend upon our faculties of understanding for
the knowledge of it in any case.</p>

<p>The assertion that there is, in the nature of things, an original
standard of right and wrong in actions, independent upon all
will, but which unalterably determines the will of God, to exercise
that moral government over the world, which religion teaches,
(<i>i.e.</i> finally and upon the whole to reward and punish men respectively
as they act right or wrong;) contains an abstract truth,
as well as matter of fact. But suppose that in the present state,
every man without exception, was rewarded and punished, in
exact proportion as he followed or transgressed that sense of
right and wrong, which God has implanted in his nature: this
would not be at all an abstract truth, but only a matter of fact.
And though this fact were acknowledged by every one, yet the
same difficulties might be raised as now are, concerning the abstract
questions of liberty and moral fitness. And we should
have a proof, even the certain one of experience, that the government
of the world was perfectly moral, without taking in the consideration
of those questions: and this proof would remain, in
what way soever they were determined.</p>

<p>Thus, God having given mankind a moral faculty, the object
of which is actions, and which naturally approves some actions
as right, and of good desert, and condemns others as wrong, and
of ill desert; that he will, finally and upon the whole, reward the
former and punish the latter, is not an assertion of an abstract
truth, but of what is as mere a fact, as his doing so at present
would be. This future fact I have not, indeed, proved with the
force with which it might be proved, from the principles of liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and moral fitness; but without them have given a really conclusive
practical proof of it, which is greatly strengthened by the
general analogy of nature; a proof easily cavilled at, easily shown
not to be demonstrative, (and it is not offered as such;) but impossible,
I think, to be evaded, or answered. Thus the obligations
of religion are made out, exclusive of the questions concerning
liberty and moral fitness; which have been perplexed
with difficulties and abstruse reasonings, as every thing may.</p>

<p>Hence therefore may be observed distinctly, what is the force
of this treatise. It will be, to such as are convinced of religion
upon the proof arising out of the two last mentioned principles,
an <em>additional</em> proof and confirmation of it: to such as do not
admit those principles, an <em>original</em> proof of it,<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and a confirmation
of that proof. Those who believe, will here find the scheme
of Christianity cleared of objections, and the evidence of it in a
peculiar manner strengthened. Those who do not believe will at
least be shown the absurdity of all attempts to prove Christianity
false, the plain undoubted credibility of it; and, I hope, a good
deal more.</p>

<p>Thus, though some perhaps may seriously think, that analogy,
as here urged, has too great stress laid upon it; and ridicule, unanswerable
ridicule, may be applied, to show the argument from
it in a disadvantageous light; yet there can be no question, but
that it is a real one. For religion, both natural and revealed,
implying in it numerous facts; analogy, being a <em>confirmation</em> of
all facts to which it can be applied, and the <em>only proof</em> of most,
cannot but be admitted by every one to be a material thing, and
truly of weight on the side of religion, both natural and revealed.
And it ought to be particularly regarded by such as profess to
follow nature, and to be less satisfied with abstract reasonings.</p>

<h3 id="II_CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Whatever account may be given of the strange inattention
and disregard, in some ages and countries, to a matter of such
importance as religion; it would, before experience, be incredible,
that there should be the like disregard in those, who have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the moral system of the world laid before them, as it is by Christianity,
and often inculcated upon them: because this moral
system carries in it a good degree of evidence for its truth, upon
its being barely proposed to our thoughts. There is no need of
abstruse reasonings and distinctions, to convince an unprejudiced
understanding, that there is a God who made and governs the
world, and will judge it in righteousness; though they may be
necessary to answer abstruse difficulties, when once such are
raised: when the very meaning of those words, which express
most intelligibly the general doctrine of religion, is pretended to
be uncertain; and the clear truth of the thing itself is obscured
by the intricacies of speculation. To an unprejudiced mind, ten
thousand thousand instances of design cannot but prove a designer.
And it is intuitively manifest, that <em>creatures</em> ought to
live under a dutiful sense of their Maker; and that justice and
charity must be his laws, to creatures whom he has made social,
and placed in society.</p>

<p>The truth of revealed religion, peculiarly so called, is not indeed
self-evident, but requires external proof, in order to its
being received. Yet inattention, among us, to revealed religion,
will be found to imply the same dissolute immoral temper of
mind, as inattention to natural religion: because, when both are
laid before us, in the manner they are in Christian countries of
liberty, our obligations to inquire into both, and to embrace both
upon supposition of their truth, are obligations of the same nature.
Revelation claims to be the voice of God: and our obligation to
attend to his voice is surely moral, in all cases. And as it is insisted,
that its evidence is conclusive, upon thorough consideration
of it; so it offers itself with obvious appearances of having
something more than human in it, and therefore in all reason
requires to have its claims most seriously examined into.</p>

<p>It is to be added, that though light and knowledge, in what
manner soever afforded, is equally from God; yet a miraculous
revelation has a peculiar tendency, from the first principles of
our nature, to awaken mankind, and inspire them with reverence
and awe. And this is a peculiar obligation, to attend to what
claims to be so, with such appearances of truth. It is therefore
most certain, that our obligations to inquire seriously into the
evidence of Christianity, and, upon supposition of its truth, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
embrace it, are of the utmost importance, and moral in the highest
and most proper sense. Let us then suppose, that the evidence
of religion in general, and of Christianity, has been seriously inquired
into, by all reasonable men among us. Yet we find many
professedly to reject both, upon speculative principles of infidelity.
All of them do not content themselves with a bare neglect
of religion, and enjoying their imaginary freedom from its
restraints. Some go much beyond this. They deride God’s
moral government over the world. They renounce his protection,
and defy his justice. They ridicule and vilify Christianity, and
blaspheme the author of it; and take all occasions to manifest
scorn and contempt of revelation. This amounts to an active
setting themselves against religion; to what may be considered
as a positive principle of irreligion, which they cultivate within
themselves; and, whether they intend this effect or not, render
habitual, as a good man does the contrary principle. Others,
who are not chargeable with all this profligateness, yet are in
avowed opposition to religion, as if discovered to be groundless.</p>

<p>Now admitting, which is the supposition we go upon, that
these persons act upon what they think principles of reason, (and
otherwise they are not to be argued with,) it is really inconceivable,
that they should imagine they clearly see the whole evidence
of it, considered in itself, to be nothing at all: nor do they pretend
this. They are far indeed from having a just notion of its
evidence: but they would not say its evidence was nothing, if
they thought the system of it, with all its circumstances, were
credible, like other matters of science or history. Their manner
of treating it must proceed, either from such kind of objections
against all religion, as have been answered or obviated in the
former part of this treatise; or else from objections, and difficulties,
supposed more peculiar to Christianity. Thus, they
entertain prejudices against the whole notion of a revelation, and
miraculous interpositions. They find things in Scripture, whether
in incidental passages, or in the general scheme of it, which
appear to them unreasonable. They take for granted, that if
Christianity were true, the light of it must have been more
general, and the evidence of it more satisfactory, or rather overpowering:
that it must and would have been, in some way, otherwise
put and left, than it is. Now this is not imagining they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
see the evidence itself to be nothing, or inconsiderable; but quite
another thing. It is being fortified <em>against</em> the evidence, in
some degree acknowledged, by thinking they see the system of
Christianity, or something which appears to them necessarily connected
with it, to be incredible or false; fortified against that
evidence, which might otherwise make great impression upon
them. Or, lastly, if any of these persons are, upon the whole, in
doubt concerning the truth of Christianity; their behavior seems
owing to their taking for granted, through strange inattention,
that such doubting is, in a manner, the same thing as being
certain against it.</p>

<p>To these persons, and to this state of opinion concerning religion,
the foregoing treatise is adapted. For, all the general
objections against the moral system of nature having been obviated,
it is shown, that there is not any peculiar presumption at
all against Christianity, considered either as not discoverable by
reason, or as unlike to what is so discovered; nor any, worth
mentioning, against it as miraculous, if any at all; none, certainly,
which can render it in the least incredible. It is shown,
that, upon supposition of a divine revelation, the analogy of
nature renders it beforehand highly credible, I think probable,
that many things in it must appear liable to great objections;
and that we must be incompetent judges of it, to a great degree.
This observation is, I think, unquestionably true, and of the very
utmost importance. But it is urged, as I hope it will be understood,
with great caution not to vilify the faculty of reason,
which is <cite>the candle of the Lord within us</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> though it can afford
no light, where it does not shine; nor judge, where it has no
principles to judge upon. The objections here spoken of, being
first answered in the view of objections against Christianity as a
matter of fact, are in the next place considered as urged more
immediately against the wisdom, justice, and goodness of the
Christian dispensation. And it is fully made out, that they
admit of exactly the like answer, in every respect, to what the
like objections against the constitution of nature admit of: that,
as partial views give the appearance of wrong to things, which,
upon further consideration and knowledge of their relations to
other things, are found just and good; so it is perfectly credible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that the things objected against the wisdom and goodness of the
Christian dispensation, may be rendered instances of wisdom
and goodness, by their reference to other things beyond our
view. Because Christianity is a scheme as much above our
comprehension, as that of nature; and like that, a scheme in
which means are made use of to accomplish ends, and which,
as is most credible, may be carried on by general laws. And
it ought to be attended to, that this is not an answer taken
merely or chiefly from our ignorance: but from something positive,
which our observation shows us. For, to like objections,
the like answer is experienced to be just, in numberless parallel
cases.</p>

<p>The objections against the Christian dispensation, and the
method by which it is carried on, having been thus obviated, in
general, and together; the chief of them are considered distinctly,
and the particular things objected to are shown credible,
by their perfect analogy, each apart, to the constitution of nature.
Thus, if man be fallen from his primitive state, and to be restored,
and infinite wisdom and power engages in accomplishing
our recovery: it were to have been expected, it is said, that this
should have been effected at once; and not by such a long series
of means, and such a various economy of persons and things;
one dispensation preparatory to another, this to a further one,
and so on through an indefinite number of ages, before the end
of the scheme proposed can be completely accomplished; a
scheme conducted by infinite wisdom, and executed by almighty
power. But now, on the contrary, our finding that every thing
in the constitution and course of nature is thus carried on, shows
such expectations concerning revelation to be highly unreasonable;
and is a satisfactory answer to them, when urged as objections
against the credibility, that the great scheme of Providence
in the redemption of the world may be of this kind, and to be
accomplished in this manner.</p>

<p>As to the particular method of our redemption, the appointment
of a Mediator between God and man: this has been shown
to be most obviously analogous to the general conduct of nature,
<i>i.e.</i> the God of nature, in appointing others to be the instruments
of his mercy, as we experience in the daily course of Providence.
The condition of this world, which the doctrine of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
redemption by Christ presupposes, so much falls in with natural
appearances, that heathen moralists inferred it from those appearances:
inferred that human nature was fallen from its original
rectitude, and in consequence of this, degraded from its primitive
happiness. However this opinion came into the world, these
appearances kept up the tradition, and confirmed the belief of it.
And as it was the general opinion under the light of nature, that
repentance and reformation, alone and by itself, was not sufficient
to do away sin, and procure a full remission of the penalties annexed
to it; and as the reason of the thing does not at all lead
to any such conclusion; so every day’s experience shows us, that
reformation is not, in any sort, sufficient to prevent the present disadvantages
and miseries, which, in the natural course of things,
God has annexed to folly and extravagance.</p>

<p>Yet there may be ground to think, that the punishments,
which, by the general laws of divine government, are annexed
to vice, may be prevented: that provision may have been, even
originally, made, that they should be prevented by some means
or other, though they could not by reformation alone. For we
have daily instances of <em>such mercy</em>, in the general conduct of
nature: compassion provided for misery,<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> medicines for diseases,
friends against enemies. There is provision made, in the original
constitution of the world, that much of the natural bad consequences
of our follies, which persons themselves alone cannot
prevent, may be prevented by the assistance of others; assistance
which nature enables, and disposes, and appoints them to afford.
By a method of goodness analogous to this, when the world lay
in wickedness, and consequently in ruin, <cite>God so loved the world,
that he gave his only-begotten Son</cite> to save it: and <cite>he being made
perfect by suffering, became the author of eternal salvation to all
them that obey him</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Indeed neither reason nor analogy would
lead us to think, in particular, that the interposition of Christ, in
the manner in which he did interpose, would be of that efficacy
for recovery of the world, which the Scripture teaches us it was.
But neither would reason nor analogy lead us to think, that other
particular means would be of the efficacy, which experience shows
they are, in numberless instances. Therefore, as the case before
us does not admit of experience; so, that neither reason nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
analogy can show how, or in what particular way, the interposition
of Christ, as revealed in Scripture, is of that efficacy, which
it is there represented to be; this is no kind nor degree of presumption
against its being really of that efficacy.</p>

<p>Further: the objections against Christianity, from the light of
it not being universal, nor its evidence so strong as might possibly
be given, have been answered by the general analogy of
nature. That God has made such variety of creatures, is indeed
an answer to the former: but that he dispenses his gifts in such
variety, both of degrees and kinds, among creatures of the same
species, and even to the same individuals at different times; is a
more obvious and full answer to it. And it is so far from being
the method of Providence in other cases, to afford us such overbearing
evidence, as some require in proof of Christianity; that
on the contrary, the evidence upon which we are naturally appointed
to act in common matters, throughout a very great part
of life, is doubtful in a high degree. And admitting the fact,
that God has afforded to some no more than doubtful evidence of
religion; the same account may be given of it, as of difficulties
and temptations with regard to practice. But as it is not impossible,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
surely, that this alleged doubtfulness may be men’s
own fault; it deserves their most serious consideration, whether
it be not so. However, it is certain, that doubting implies a
<em>degree</em> of evidence for that of which we doubt: and that this
degree of evidence as really lays us under obligations as demonstrative
evidence.</p>

<p>The whole of religion then is throughout credible: nor is
there, I think, any thing, relating to the revealed dispensation
of things, more different from the experienced constitution and
course of nature, than some parts of the constitution of nature
are from other parts of it. If so, the only question which remains
is, What positive evidence can be alleged for the truth of
Christianity? This too in general has been considered, and the
objections against it estimated. Deduct, therefore, what is to
be deducted from that evidence, upon account of any weight
which may be thought to remain in these objections, after what
the analogy of nature has suggested in answer to them: and
then consider, what are the practical consequences from all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
upon the most sceptical principles one can argue upon (for I am
writing to persons who entertain these principles): and upon
such consideration it will be obvious, that immorality, as little
excuse as it admits of in itself, is greatly aggravated, in persons
who have been made acquainted with Christianity, whether they
believe it or not: because the moral system of nature, or natural
religion, which Christianity lays before us, approves itself, almost
intuitively, to a reasonable mind, upon seeing it proposed.</p>

<p>In the next place, with regard to Christianity, it will be observed
that there is a middle between a full satisfaction of the
truth of it, and a satisfaction of the contrary. The middle state
of mind between these two consists in a serious apprehension,
that it may be true, joined with doubt whether it is so. And this,
upon the best judgment I am able to make, is as far towards
speculative infidelity, as any sceptic can at all be supposed to go,
who has had true Christianity, with the proper evidences of it,
laid before him, and has in any tolerable measure considered them.
For I would not be mistaken to comprehend all who have ever
heard of it; because it seems evident, that in many countries
called Christian, neither Christianity nor its evidence, is fairly
laid before men. And in places where both are, there appear
to be some who have very little attended to either, and who reject
Christianity with a scorn proportionate to their inattention; and
yet are by no means without understanding in other matters.
Now it has been shown, that a serious apprehension that Christianity
may be true, lays persons under the strictest obligations
of a serious regard to it, throughout the whole of their life; a
regard not the same exactly, but in many respects nearly the same
with what a full conviction of its truth would lay them under.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, it will appear, that blasphemy and profaneness, with
regard to Christianity, are absolutely without excuse. There is
no temptation to it, but from the wantonness of vanity or mirth;
and those, considering the infinite importance of the subject, are
no such temptations as to afford any excuse for it. If this be a
just account of things, and yet men can go on to vilify or disregard
Christianity, which is to talk and act as if they had a
demonstration of its falsehood, there is no reason to think they
would alter their behavior to any purpose, though there were a
demonstration of its truth.</p>

<h3 id="DISSERTATION_I">DISSERTATION I.<br />
<span class="smaller">Personal Identity.</span></h3>

<p>Whether we are to live in a future state, as it is the most
important question which can possibly be asked, so it is the most
intelligible one which can be expressed in language. Yet strange
perplexities have been raised about the meaning of that identity
or sameness of person, which is implied in the notion of our
living now and hereafter, or in any two successive moments.
And the solution of these difficulties hath been stranger than the
difficulties themselves. For, personal identity has been explained
so by some, as to render the inquiry concerning a future life of no
consequence at all to us the persons who are making it. And
though few men can be misled by such subtleties; yet it may be
proper to consider them a little.</p>

<p>When it is asked <em>wherein</em> personal identity consists, the answer
should be the same, as if it were asked wherein consists similitude,
or equality; that all attempts to define would but perplex
it. Yet there is no difficulty at all in ascertaining <em>the idea</em>. For
as, upon two triangles being compared or viewed together, there
arises to the mind the idea of similitude; or upon twice two and
four, the idea of equality: so likewise, upon comparing the
consciousness of one’s self, or one’s own existence, in any two
moments, there as immediately arises to the mind the idea of
personal identity. And as the two former comparisons not only
give us the ideas of similitude and equality; but also show us
that two triangles are alike, and twice two and four are equal: so
the latter comparison not only gives us the idea of personal
identity, but also shows us the identity of ourselves in those two
moments; the present, suppose, and that immediately past; or
the present, and that a month, a year, or twenty years past. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
other words, by reflecting upon that which is myself now, and
that which was myself twenty years ago, I discern they are not
two, but one and the same self.</p>

<p>But though consciousness of what is past does thus ascertain
our personal identity to ourselves, yet to say, that it <em>makes</em> personal
identity, or is necessary to our being the same persons, is to
say, that a person has not existed a single moment, nor done one
action, but what he can remember; indeed none but what he
reflects upon. And one should really think it self-evident, that
consciousness of personal identity presupposes, and therefore
cannot constitute, personal identity; any more than knowledge,
in any other case, can constitute truth, which it presupposes.</p>

<p>This wonderful mistake may possibly have arisen from hence;
that to be endued with consciousness is inseparable from the idea
of a person, or intelligent being. For, this might be expressed
inaccurately thus, that consciousness makes personality: and
from hence it might be concluded to make personal identity.
But though present consciousness of what we at present do and
feel is necessary to our being the persons we <em>now are</em>; yet present
consciousness of past actions or feelings is not necessary to
our being the same persons who performed those actions, or <em>once
had</em> those feelings.</p>

<p>The inquiry, what makes vegetables the same, in the common
acceptation of the word, does not appear to have any relation to
this of personal identity: because, the word <em>same</em>, when applied
to them and to a person, is not only applied to different subjects,
but it is also used in different senses. For when a man swears
to the same tree, as having stood fifty years in the same place, he
means only the same as to all the purposes of property, and uses
of common life; and not that the tree has been all that time the
same, in the strict philosophical sense of the word. For he does
not know, whether any one particle of the present tree be the
same with any one particle of the tree which stood in the same
place fifty years ago. And if they have not one common particle
of matter, they cannot be the same tree in the proper philosophic
sense of the word <em>same</em>: it being evidently a contradiction in
terms, to say they are, when no part of their substance, and no
one of their properties is the same: no part of their substance,
by the supposition; no one of their properties, because it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
allowed, that the same property cannot be transferred from one
substance to another. Therefore when we say the identity of
sameness of a plant consists in a continuation of the same life,
communicated under the same organization, to a number of particles
of matter, whether the same or not; the word <em>same</em>, when
applied to life and to organization, cannot possibly be understood
to signify, what it signifies in this very sentence, when applied to
matter. In a loose and popular sense then, the life and the organization
and the plant are justly said to be the same, notwithstanding
the perpetual change of the parts. But in strict and
philosophical language, no man, no being, no mode of being, no
any thing, can be the same with that, with which it has indeed
nothing the same. Now sameness is used in this latter sense,
when applied to persons. The identity of these, therefore, cannot
subsist with diversity of substance.</p>

<p>The thing here considered, and as I think, demonstratively
determined, is proposed by Mr. Locke in these words, <i>Whether
it</i>; <i>i.e.</i> the same self or person, <i>be the same identical substance</i>?
And he has suggested what is a much better answer to the question,
than that which he gives it in form. For he defines person,
<em>a thinking intelligent being</em>, &amp;c., and personal identity, <em>the sameness
of a rational being</em>.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The question then is, whether the
same rational being is the same substance: which needs no answer,
because being and substance, in this place, stand for the
same idea. The ground of the doubt, whether the same person
be the same substance, is said to be this; that the consciousness
of our own existence, in youth and in old age, or in any two
joint successive moments, is not the <em>same individual action</em>,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
<i>i.e.</i> not the same consciousness, but different successive consciousnesses.
Now it is strange that this should have occasioned such
perplexities. For it is surely conceivable, that a person may
have a capacity of knowing some object or other to be the same
now, which it was when he contemplated it formerly: yet in this
case, where, by the supposition, the object is perceived to be the
same, the perception of it in any two moments cannot be one and
the same perception. And thus, though the successive consciousnesses,
which we have of our own existence, are not the same,
yet are they consciousnesses of one and the same thing or object;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of the same person, self, or living agent. The person, of whose
existence the consciousness is felt now, and was felt an hour or a
year ago, is discerned to be; not two persons, but one and the
same person; and therefore is one and the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Locke’s observations upon this subject appear hasty: and
he seems to profess himself dissatisfied with suppositions, which
he has made relating to it.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> But some of those hasty observations
have been carried to a strange length by others; whose
notion, when traced and examined to the bottom, amounts, I
think, to this:<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> “That personality is not a permanent, but a transient
thing: that it lives and dies, begins and ends continually:
that no one can any more remain one and the same person two
moments together, than two successive moments can be one and
the same moment: that our substance is indeed continually
changing; but whether this be so or not, is, it seems, nothing to
the purpose; since it is not substance, but consciousness alone,
which constitutes personality: which consciousness, being successive,
cannot be the same in any two moments, nor consequently
the personality constituted by it.” Hence it must follow, that it
is a fallacy upon ourselves, to charge our present selves with any
thing we did, or to imagine our present selves interested in any
thing which befell us yesterday; or that our present self will be
interested in what will befall us to-morrow: since our present
self is not, in reality, the same with the self of yesterday, but
another like self or person coming in its room, and mistaken for
it; to which another self will succeed to-morrow. This, I say,
must follow. For if the self or person of to-day, and that of to-morrow,
are not the same, but only like persons; the person of
to-day is really no more interested in what will befall the person
of to-morrow, than in what will befall any other person.</p>

<p>It may be thought, perhaps, that this is not a just representation
of the opinion we are speaking of: because those who maintain
it allow, that a person is the same as far back as his remembrance
reaches. Indeed they use the words, <em>identity</em>, and <em>same
person</em>. Nor will language permit these words to be laid aside;
since if they were, there must be I know not what ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
periphrasis substituted in the room of them. But they cannot,
<em>consistently with themselves</em>, mean, that the person is really the
same. For it is self-evident, that the personality cannot be really
the same, if, as they expressly assert, that in which it consists is
not the same. And as, consistently with themselves, they cannot,
so, I think it appears, they do not <em>mean</em>, that the person is
<em>really</em> the same, but only that he is so in a fictitious sense: in
such a sense only as they assert, for this they do assert, that any
number of persons whatever may be the same person. The bare
unfolding this notion, and laying it thus naked and open, seems
the best confutation of it. However, since great stress is said to
be put upon it, I add the following things.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, This notion is absolutely contradictory to that certain
conviction, which necessarily and every moment rises within us,
when we turn our thoughts upon ourselves, when we reflect upon
what is past, and look forward upon what is to come. All imagination
of a daily change of that living agent which each man
calls himself, for another, or of any such change throughout our
whole present life, is entirely borne down by our natural sense
of things. Nor is it possible for a person in his wits to alter his
conduct, with regard to his health or affairs, from a suspicion,
that, though he should live to-morrow, he should not, however,
be the same person he is to-day. Yet, if it be reasonable to act,
with respect to a future life, upon the notion that personality is
transient, it is reasonable to act upon it, with respect to the present.
Here then is a notion equally applicable to religion and to
temporal concerns. Every one sees and feels the inexpressible
absurdity of it in the latter case; therefore, if any can take up
with it in the former, this cannot proceed from the reason of the
thing, but must be owing to inward unfairness, and secret corruption
of heart.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, It is not an idea, or abstract notion, or quality, but
a <em>being</em> only, which is capable of life and action, of happiness and
misery. Now all beings confessedly continue the same, during
the whole time of their existence. Consider then a living being
now existing, and which has existed for any time alive. This
living being must have done and suffered and enjoyed, what it
has done and suffered and enjoyed formerly, (this living being, I
say, and not another) as really as it does and suffers and enjoys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
what it does and suffers and enjoys this instant. All these successive
actions, enjoyments, and sufferings, are actions, enjoyments,
and sufferings, of the same living being. And they are
so, prior to all consideration of its remembering or forgetting:
since remembering or forgetting can make no alteration in the
truth of past matter of fact. And suppose this being endued
with limited powers of knowledge and memory, there is no
more difficulty in conceiving it to have a power of knowing
itself to be the same living being which it was some time ago,
of remembering some of its actions, sufferings, and enjoyments,
and forgetting others, than in conceiving it to know or remember
or forget any thing else.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Every person is <em>conscious</em>, that he is now the same
person or self he was as far back as his remembrance reaches:
since when any one reflects upon a past action of his own, he
is just as certain of the person who did that action, namely,
himself who now reflects upon it, as he is certain that the
action was done at all. Nay, very often a person’s assurance
of an action having been done, of which he is absolutely assured,
arises wholly from the consciousness that he himself did it.
This he, person, or self, must either be a substance, or the
property of some substance. If he, a person, be a substance;
then consciousness that he is the same person is consciousness
that he is the same substance. If the person, or he, be the
property of a substance, still consciousness that he is the same
property is as certain a proof that his substance remains the
same, as consciousness that he remains the same substance would
be; since the same property cannot be transferred from one
substance to another.</p>

<p>But though we are thus certain, that we are the same agents,
living beings, or substances, now, which we were as far back as
our remembrance reaches; yet it is asked, whether we may not
possibly be deceived in it? And this question may be asked at
the end of any demonstration whatever: because it is a question
concerning the truth of perception by memory. He who can
doubt, whether perception by memory can in this case be depended
upon, may doubt also, whether perception by deduction
and reasoning, which also include memory, or indeed whether
intuitive perception can. Here then we can go no further. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
it is ridiculous to attempt to prove the truth of those perceptions,
whose truth we can no otherwise prove, than by other perceptions
of exactly the same kind with them, and which there is just the
same ground to suspect; or to attempt to prove the truth of our
faculties, which can no otherwise be proved, than by the use or
means of those very suspected faculties themselves.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<h3 id="DISSERTATION_II">DISSERTATION II.<br />
<span class="smaller">The Nature of Virtue.</span></h3>

<p>That which renders beings capable of moral government, is
their having a moral nature, and moral faculties of perception
and of action. Brute creatures are impressed and actuated by
various instincts and propensions: so also are we. But additional
to this, we have a capacity of reflecting upon actions and
characters, and making them an object to our thought: and on
doing this, we naturally and unavoidably approve some actions,
under the peculiar view of their being virtuous and of good
desert; and disapprove others, as vicious and of ill desert. That
we have this moral approving and disapproving<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> faculty, is certain
from our experiencing it in ourselves, and recognising it in
each other. It appears from our exercising it unavoidably, in the
approbation and disapprobation even of feigned characters; from
the words right and wrong, odious and amiable, base and worthy,
with many others of like signification in all languages applied to
actions and characters: from the many written systems of morals
which suppose it, since it cannot be imagined, that all these
authors, throughout all these treatises, had absolutely no meaning
at all to their words, or a meaning merely chimerical: from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
our natural sense of gratitude, which, implies a distinction between
merely being the instrument of good, and intending it:
from the distinction every one makes between injury and mere
harm, which, Hobbes says, is peculiar to mankind; and between
injury and just punishment, a distinction plainly natural, prior
to the consideration of human laws.</p>

<p>It is manifest that great part of common language, and of
common behavior over the world, is formed upon supposition of
such a moral faculty; whether called conscience, moral reason,
moral sense, or divine reason; whether considered as a sentiment
of the understanding, or as a perception of the heart; or, which
seems the truth, as including both. Nor is it at all doubtful in
the general, what course of action this faculty, or practical discerning
power within us, approves and what it disapproves. For,
as much as it has been disputed wherein virtue consists, or whatever
ground for doubt there may be about particulars; yet, in
general, there is in reality a universally acknowledged standard
of it. It is that, which all ages and all countries have made
profession of in public: it is that, which every man you meet
puts on the show of: it is that, which the primary and fundamental
laws of all civil constitutions over the face of the earth
make it their business and endeavor to enforce the practice of
upon mankind: namely, justice, veracity, and regard to common
good. It being manifest then, in general, that we have such a
faculty or discernment as this, it may be of use to remark some
things more distinctly concerning it.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, It ought to be observed, that the object of this faculty
is actions,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> comprehending under that name active or practical
principles: those principles from which men would act, if occasions
and circumstances gave them power; and which, when
fixed and habitual in any person, we call his character. It does
not appear, that brutes have the least reflex sense of actions, as
distinguished from events: or that will and design, which constitute
the very nature of actions as such, are at all an object to
their perception. But to ours they are: and they are the object,
and the only one, of the approving and disapproving faculty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Acting, conduct, behavior, abstracted from all regard to what is
in fact and event the consequence of it, is itself the natural object
of the moral discernment; as speculative truth and falsehood
is of speculative reason. Intention of such and such
consequences, is indeed, always included; for it is part of the
action itself: but though the intended good or bad consequences
do not follow, we have exactly the same sense of the <em>action</em>, as
if they did. In like manner we think well or ill of characters,
abstracted from all consideration of the good or the evil, which
persons of such characters have it actually in their power to do.
We never, in the moral way, applaud or blame either ourselves
or others, for what we enjoy or what we suffer, or for having impressions
made upon us, which we consider as altogether out of
our power: but only for what we do or would have done, had it
been in our power: or for what we leave undone, which we might
have done, or would have left undone, though we could have
done.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Our sense or discernment of actions as morally good
or evil, implies in it a sense or discernment of them as of good
or ill desert. It may be difficult to explain this perception,
so as to answer all the questions which may be asked concerning
it: but every one speaks of such and such actions as
deserving punishment; and it is not, I suppose, pretended, that
they have absolutely no meaning at all to the expression. Now
the meaning plainly is not, that we conceive it for the good of
society, that the doer of such actions should be made to suffer.
For if, unhappily, it were resolved, that a man, who by some
innocent action, was infected with the plague, should be left to
perish, lest, by other people’s coming near him, the infection
should spread; no one would say he <em>deserved</em> this treatment.
Innocence and ill desert are inconsistent ideas. Ill desert always
supposes guilt: and if one be no part of the other, yet they are
evidently and naturally connected in our mind. The sight of a
man in misery raises our compassion towards him; and if this
misery be inflicted on him by another, our indignation against
the author of it. But when we are informed, that the sufferer
is a villain, and is punished only for his treachery or cruelty;
our compassion exceedingly lessens, and in many instances our
indignation wholly subsides. Now what produces this effect is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the conception of that in the sufferer, which we call ill desert.
Upon considering then, or viewing together, our notion of vice
and that of misery, there results a third, that of ill desert. And
thus there is in human creatures an association of the two ideas,
natural and moral evil, wickedness and punishment. If this
association were merely artificial or accidental, it were nothing:
but being most unquestionably natural, it greatly concerns us to
attend to it, instead of endeavoring to explain it away.</p>

<p>It may be observed further, concerning our perception of good
and of ill desert, that the former is very weak with respect to
common instances of virtue. One reason of which may be, that
it does not appear to a spectator, how far such instances of virtue
proceed from a virtuous principle, or in what degree this principle
is prevalent: since a very weak regard to virtue may be sufficient
to make men act well in many common instances. On the other
hand, our perception of ill desert in vicious actions lessens, in
proportion to the temptations men are thought to have had to
such vices. For, vice in human creatures consisting chiefly in
the absence or want of the virtuous principle; though a man be
overcome, suppose by tortures, it does not from thence appear to
what degree the virtuous principle was wanting. All that appears
is, that he had it not in such a degree, as to prevail over
the temptation; but possibly he had it in a degree, which would
have rendered him proof against common temptations.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Our perception of vice and ill desert arises from, and
is the result of, a comparison of actions with the nature and capacities
of the agent. For the mere neglect of doing what we
ought to do, would, in many cases, be determined by all men to
be in the highest degree vicious. This determination must arise
from such comparison, and be the result of it; because such
neglect would not be vicious in creatures of other natures and
capacities, as brutes. It is the same also with respect to positive
vices, or such as consist in doing what we ought not. For
every one has a different sense of harm done by an idiot, madman,
or child, and by one of mature and common understanding;
though the action of both, including the intention, which is part
of the action, be the same: as it may be, since idiots and madmen,
as well as children, are capable not only of doing mischief
but also of intending it. Now this difference must arise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
somewhat discerned in the nature or capacities of one, which
renders the action vicious; and the want of which, in the other,
renders the same action innocent or less vicious: and this plainly
supposes a comparison, whether reflected upon or not, between
the action and capacities of the agent, previous to our determining
an action to be vicious. Hence arises a proper application of the
epithets, incongruous, unsuitable, disproportionate, unfit, to actions
which our moral faculty determines to be vicious.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, It deserves to be considered, whether men are more
at liberty, in point of morals, to make themselves miserable without
reason, than to make other people so: or dissolutely to
neglect their own greater good, for the sake of a present lesser
gratification, than they are to neglect the good of others, whom
nature has committed to their care. It would seem, that a due
concern about our own interest or happiness, and a reasonable
endeavor to secure and promote it, (which is, I think, very much
the meaning of the word prudence, in our language;) it would
seem, that this is virtue, and the contrary behavior faulty and
blamable; since, in the calmest way of reflection, we approve of
the first, and condemn the other conduct, both in ourselves and
others. This approbation and disapprobation are altogether
different from mere desire of our own, or of their happiness, and
from sorrow upon missing it. For the object or occasion of this
last kind of perception is satisfaction or uneasiness: whereas the
object of the first is active behavior. In one case, what our
thoughts fix upon is our condition: in the other, our conduct.</p>

<p>It is true indeed, that nature has not given us so sensible a
disapprobation of imprudence and folly, either in <em>ourselves</em> or
<em>others</em>, as of falsehood, injustice, and cruelty: I suppose, because
that constant habitual sense of private interest and good, which
we always carry about with us, renders such sensible disapprobation
less necessary, less wanting, to keep us from imprudently
neglecting our own happiness, and foolishly injuring ourselves,
than it is necessary and wanting to keep us from injuring others;
to whose good we cannot have so strong and constant a regard:
and also because imprudence and folly, appearing to bring its
own punishment more immediately and constantly than injurious
behavior, it less needs the additional punishment, which would
be inflicted upon it by others, had they the same sensible indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
against it, as against injustice, and fraud, and cruelty. Besides,
unhappiness being in itself the natural object of compassion,
the unhappiness which people bring upon themselves, though it
be wilfully, excites in us some pity for them; and this of course
lessens our displeasure against them. Still it is matter of experience,
that we are formed so as to reflect very severely upon the
greater instances of imprudent neglect and foolish rashness, both
in ourselves and others. In instances of this kind, men often
say of themselves with remorse, and of others with some indignation,
that they deserved to suffer such calamities, because they
brought them upon themselves, and would not take warning.
Particularly when persons come to poverty and distress by a long
course of extravagance, and after frequent admonitions, though
without falsehood or injustice; we plainly, do not regard such
people as alike objects of compassion with those, who are brought
into the same condition by unavoidable accidents. From these
things it appears, that prudence is a species of virtue, and folly
of vice: meaning by <em>folly</em>, something quite different from mere
incapacity; a thoughtless want of that regard and attention to
our own happiness, which we had capacity for. And this the
word properly includes; and, as it seems, in its usual acceptation:
for we scarcely apply it to brute creatures.</p>

<p>However, if any person be disposed to dispute the matter, I
shall very willingly give him up the words virtue and vice, as
not applicable to prudence and folly: but must insist, that the
faculty within us, which is the judge of actions, approves of prudent
actions, and disapproves imprudent ones: I say prudent and
imprudent <em>actions</em> as such, and considered distinctly from the
happiness or misery which they occasion. And by the way, this
observation may help to determine what justness there is in the
objection against religion, that it teaches us to be interested and
selfish.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, Without inquiring how far, and in what sense, virtue
is resolvable into benevolence, and vice into the want of it; it
may be proper to observe, that benevolence, and the want of it,
singly considered, are in no sort the <em>whole</em>, of virtue and vice.
For if this were the case, in the review of one’s own character, or
that of others, our moral understanding and moral sense would
be indifferent to every thing, but the degrees in which benevolence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
prevailed, and the degrees in which it was wanting. That
is, we should neither approve of benevolence to some persons
rather than to others, nor disapprove injustice and falsehood upon
any other account, than merely as an overbalance of happiness
was foreseen likely to be produced by the first, and of misery by
the second. On the contrary, suppose two men competitors for
any thing whatever, which would be of equal advantage to each
of them; though nothing indeed would be more impertinent,
than for a stranger to busy himself to get one of them preferred
to the other; yet such endeavor would be virtue, in behalf of a
friend or benefactor, abstracted from all consideration of distant
consequences: as that examples of gratitude, and the cultivation
of friendship, would be of general good to the world. Again,
suppose one man should, by fraud or violence, take from another
the fruit of his labor, with intent to give it to a third, who he
thought would have as much pleasure from it as would balance
the pleasure which the first possessor would have had in the
enjoyment, and his vexation in the loss of it; suppose also that
no bad consequences would follow: yet such an action would
surely be vicious. Nay further, were treachery, violence, and
injustice, no otherwise vicious, than as foreseen likely to produce
an overbalance of misery to society; then, if in any case a man
could procure to himself as great advantage by an act of injustice,
as the whole foreseen inconvenience, likely to be brought upon
others by it, would amount to; such a piece of injustice would
not be faulty or vicious at all: because it would be no more than,
in any other case, for a man to prefer his own satisfaction to
another’s, in equal degrees.</p>

<p>The fact, then, appears to be, that we are <em>constituted</em> so as to
condemn falsehood, unprovoked violence, injustice, and to approve
of benevolence to some preferably to others, abstracted
from all consideration, which conduct is likeliest to produce an
overbalance of happiness or misery. Therefore, were the Author
of nature to propose nothing to himself as an end but the production
of happiness, were his moral character merely that of
benevolence; yet ours is not so. Upon that supposition indeed,
the only reason of his giving us the above mentioned approbation
of benevolence to some persons rather than others, and disapprobation
of falsehood, unprovoked violence, and injustice, must be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
that he foresaw this constitution of our nature would produce
more happiness, than forming us with a temper of mere general
benevolence. But still, since this is our constitution, falsehood,
violence, injustice, must be vice in us; and benevolence to some,
preferably to others, virtue; abstracted from all consideration of
the overbalance of evil or good, which they may appear likely to
produce.</p>

<p>Now if human creatures are endued with such a moral nature
as we have been explaining, or with a moral faculty, the natural
object of which is actions: moral government must consist in
rendering them happy and unhappy, in rewarding and punishing
them, as they follow, neglect, or depart from, the moral rule of
action interwoven in their nature, or suggested and enforced by
this moral faculty;<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> in rewarding and punishing them upon account
of their so doing.</p>

<p>I am not sensible that I have, in this fifth observation, contradicted
what any author designed to assert. But some of great
and distinguished merit, have, I think, expressed themselves in
a manner, which may occasion some danger, to careless readers,
of imagining the whole of virtue to consist in singly aiming, according
to the best of their judgment, at promoting the happiness
of mankind in the present state; and the whole of vice, in doing
what they foresee, or might foresee, is likely to produce an overbalance
of unhappiness in it: than which mistakes, none can be
conceived more terrible. For it is certain, that some of the most
shocking instances of injustice, adultery, murder, perjury, and
even of persecution, may, in many supposable cases, not have the
appearance of being likely to produce an overbalance of misery
in the present state; perhaps sometimes may have the contrary
appearance.</p>

<p>This reflection might easily be carried on, but I forbear. The
happiness of the world is the concern of Him who is the lord and
the proprietor of it: nor do we know what we are about, when
we endeavor to promote the good of mankind in any ways, but
those which he has directed; that is indeed in all ways not contrary
to veracity and justice. I speak thus upon supposition of
persons really endeavoring, in some sort, to do good without
regard to these. But the truth seems to be; that such supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
endeavors proceed, almost always, from ambition, the spirit of
party, or some indirect principle, concealed perhaps in great
measure from persons themselves. And though it is our business
and our duty to endeavor, within the bounds of veracity and
justice, to contribute to the ease, convenience, and even cheerfulness
and diversion of our fellow-creatures: yet, from our short
views, it is greatly uncertain, whether this endeavor will, in particular
instances, produce an overbalance of happiness upon the
whole; since so many and distant things must come into the account.
And that which makes it our duty is, that there is some
appearance that it will, and no positive appearance sufficient to
balance this, on the contrary side; and also, that such benevolent
endeavor is a cultivation of that most excellent of all virtuous
principles, the active principle of benevolence.</p>

<p>However, though veracity, as well as justice, is to be our rule
of life; it must be added, otherwise a snare will be laid in the
way of some plain men, that the use of common forms of speech,
generally understood, cannot be falsehood; and in general, that
there can be no designed falsehood, without designing to deceive.
It must likewise be observed, that in numberless cases, a man
may be under the strictest obligations to what he foresees will
deceive, without his intending it. For it is impossible not to
foresee, that the words and actions of men, in different ranks and
employments, and of different educations, will perpetually be
mistaken by each other. And it cannot but be so, while they
will judge with the utmost carelessness, as they daily do, of what
they are not, perhaps, enough informed to be competent judges
of, even though they considered it with great attention.</p>

not because lacking in just analogies, but because infected with the obscure
metaphysics of that age. His reasoning, however, only serves to show that B.
has perhaps made too much of the argument from the indivisibility of consciousness;
and by no means that he does not fairly use it.</p>

<p>We certainly cannot object that the subject of identity is not made plain.
Who has explained identity, or motion, or cohesion, or crystallization, or any
thing? Locke goes squarely at the subject of personal identity, (see Essay,
ch. 27,) but has rendered us small aid. His definition is, “Existence itself,
which determines a being of any sort, to a particular time and place, incommunicable
to two beings of the same kind.” I had rather define it “the uninterrupted
continuance of being.” What ceases to exist, cannot again exist:
for then it would exist after it had ceased to exist, and would have existed before
it existed. Locke makes <em>consciousness</em> to constitute identity, and argues
that a man and a person are not the same; and that hence if I kill a man, but
was not conscious of what I did, or have utterly forgotten, I am not the same
person. Watts shows up this notion of Locke very ludicrously.Butler, in his “Dissertation,” urges that consciousness <em>presupposes</em> identity,
as knowledge presupposes truth. On Locke’s theory, no person would have
existed any earlier than the period to which his memory extends. We cannot
suppose the soul made up of many consciousnesses, nor could memory, if material,
spread itself over successive years of life.]</p>

should be thought to relate more peculiarly to this doctrine, as taught in Scripture,
the reader is desired to observe, that Gentile writers, both moralists and
poets, speak of the future punishment of the wicked, both as to the duration
and degree of it, in a like manner of expression and of description, as the
Scripture does. So that all which can positively be asserted to be matter of
mere revelation, with regard to this doctrine, seems to be, that the great distinction
between the righteous and the wicked, shall be made at the end of this
world; that each shall <em>then</em> receive according to his deserts. Reason did, as it
well might, conclude that it should, finally and upon the whole, be well with
the righteous, and ill with the wicked: but it could not be determined upon
any principles of reason, whether human creatures might not have been appointed
to pass through other states of life and being, before that distributive
justice should finally and effectually take place. Revelation teaches us, that
the next state of things after the present is appointed for the execution of this
justice; that it shall be no longer delayed; but <em>the mystery of God</em>, the great
mystery of his suffering vice and confusion to prevail, <em>shall then be finished</em>;

right, is our happiness, no less than our duty. This again is based upon a conviction
that God governs justly; and has all power over us for good or evil.
As creation is full of the evidences of <em>design</em>, so is Providence. And as the
human mind shows, in its structure, the most exquisite marks of design, so the
government of mind shows a final object for all our faculties. Among the
attributes of mind we observe, conspicuous, a disposition to seek ends, lay
plans, and sacrifice present indulgence to future and greater good: and a
facility in learning how to subordinate one thing to another, so as to secure
success in our plans. This, with conscience to approve or disapprove our
modes, constitutes an evident <em>adaptedness</em> to a moral government on the part
of God; and would be worse than superfluous, if there be no such government.
Every rule of action, deduced by reason from the light of nature, may fairly be
regarded as God’s law; and the inconveniences resulting from wrong actions,
are God’s retributions. These retributions, felt or observed, are divine teachings,
saying, emphatically, if you act thus you shall receive thus. We do
actually so judge, in relation to physics. Every rule of motion, distance,
gravitation, heat, electricity, &amp;c. &amp;c., is received as God’s law; and we would

disorder and damage would ensue from the first sin: and in saying this, avoids
any incongruity with the Mosaic account, which tells us how much. What B.
says of the formation of habit, by repeated transgressions, certainly cannot be
gainsayed.Adam “died,” the very day he ate the forbidden fruit. The sinner “lives”
the very day he believes on the only-begotten Son of God. Increase of guilt,
or growth in grace are predicable in both instances. In both also there is an
instant transition into a new relationship with God.]</p>

by what is fit, by the right and reason of the case; though one chooses
to decline matters of such abstract speculation, and to speak with caution when
one does speak of them. But if it be intelligible to say, that <em>it is fit and
reasonable for every one to consult his own happiness</em>, then <em>fitness of action, or
the right and reason of the case</em>, is an intelligible manner of speaking. And
it seems as inconceivable, to suppose God to approve one course of action, or
one end, preferably to another, which yet his acting at all from design implies
that he does, without supposing somewhat prior in that end, to be the ground
of the preference; as to suppose him to discern an abstract proposition to be
true, without supposing somewhat prior in it, to be the ground of the discernment.
It doth not therefore appear, that moral right is any more relative to
perception, than abstract truth is; or that it is any more improper to speak of
the fitness and lightness of actions and ends, as founded in the nature of things,
than to speak of abstract truth, as thus founded.</p>

till we first satisfy ourselves that God could or would make any such

by Butler, is just, but very liable to abuse. Clearly, the Bible must be
so interpreted as to agree with <em>all</em> known truth, whether of natural religion or
natural science. At the same time, to correct the theology of the Bible by the
theology of nature, as finite and guilty men understand it, may involve the
rejection of Bible theology entirely; and of the very light and teaching it was
intended to supply. The converse of Butler’s statement is equally true, and
even more important. If in natural theology there be found any facts, the
seeming lesson of which is contrary to revealed religion, such seeming lesson
is not the real one.” Practically, it will be found that seeming meanings of
Scripture, really erroneous, are corrected by other parts of Scripture itself. I
understand Butler as only affirming that we must interpret Scripture according
to immutable principles, and <em>known truth</em>. The infidel rejects it for not conforming
to his <em>assumed hypothesis</em>.]</p>

of the writers against Hume on Miracles,” in confounding the improbability of
an event, before its occurrence, with the improbability afterwards; that is, considering
them equal in degree. He fully proves that the great Laplace fell
into this error, and the student should consult the passage.Prof. <span class="smcap">Fitzgerald</span> holds Butler to have fallen into the mistake adverted to
by Mills; and quotes the latter author in a way which seems to make him say
that such is his opinion also. I do not so understand Mills, nor do I see that
Butler has confounded these meanings; but the very contrary. He expressly
affirms, and most truly, that the strongest presumption may lie against “the
most ordinary facts <em>before the proof</em> which yet is overcome by almost any
proof.” Butler’s position here, may be thus illustrated. Suppose a hundred
numbers to be put in a box, and it is proposed to draw out the number 42.
Now there are 99 chances to 1 against drawing that, or any other <em>given</em> number.
But suppose a child tells you he put the hundred numbers into a box, and drew
out one, and it proved to be 42; you at once believe, for that was as likely to
come as any other.The proof of Christianity from prophecy becomes amazingly strong, thus
viewed. There are many predictions, for instance that Christ should be born
at a certain time, and place, and under certain very particular circumstances.
The probabilities against such a <em>conjuncture</em> of events are almost infinite; yet
they happened exactly as foretold.]</p>

force is not seen without reflection. “If contrivance or accident could have
given to Christianity <em>any</em> of its apparent testimonies, its miracles, its prophecies,
its morals, its propagation, or [the character of] its founder, there could
be no room to believe, or even imagine, that <em>all</em> these appearances of great
credibility, could be <em>united together</em>, by any such means. If successful craft
could have contrived its public miracles, or the pretence of them, it requires
another reach of craft, to adopt its prophecies to the same object. Further, it
required not only a different, but a totally opposite art to conceive and promulgate
its admirable morals. Again, its propagation, in defiance of the
powers and terrors of the world, implied still other qualities of action. Lastly,
the model of the life of its founder, is a work of such originality and wisdom,
as could be the offspring only of consummate powers of invention, or rather
never could have been <em>devised</em>, but must have come from real life. The hypothesis
sinks under its incredibility. Each of these suppositions of contrivance,
being arbitrary and unsupported, the climax of them is an extravagance.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Davison</span>,

contradistinction from all other faculties, or natural principles of action; in

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
